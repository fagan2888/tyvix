        <div class="content editable"><h2>The anchor yield curve</h2><p>There are countless types of interest rates in the marketplace reflecting the diverse base of borrowers and activities being financed, and there's no universal cost of borrowing across individuals or institutions. From the lending perspective, however, the Treasury curve sets a baseline for the time value of money in the sense that it represents the return on a dollar with the lowest default and liquidity risk that's obtainable by all investors. It follows that the return on riskier lending should provide some premium over the equivalent Treasury yield, and this establishes a tight structural linkage between the Treasury curve and the yield on most fixed income assets.&nbsp;</p><p>Corporate bond yields can be decomposed into the Treasury yield plus a ``credit spread,'' which is commonly interpreted as the additional return investors demand to be compensated for the risk of default and illiquidity of the bond.&nbsp;</p><p>%graphic: bond spread decomposition - YIDING/YOSHIKI</p><p>A tight spread generally reflects investors' belief that the borrower is likely to repay, and it makes sense that a company with strong credit gets to borrow at interest rates similar to those paid by the government. A bond with a credit rating higher than or equal to BBB- by S&amp;P or Baa3 by Moody's is considered ``investment grade'' and is quoted as a spread to the on-the-run benchmark Treasury bond with a similar duration. For example, a corporate bond offered at T+18 means it's priced at 18 basis points above the benchmark Treasury yield.</p><p>At the other extreme, when the credit spread overwhelms the pure interest rate component, the so-called ``high yield'' bonds cease to be quoted as a spread to Treasuries and are instead traded on a price basis. In other words, the interest that must be paid by companies operating hand to mouth should have little to do with the Treasury curve. The same could be said of other high yielding fixed income assets, such as non-agency mortgages.</p><p>Another important curve in the US dollar interest rate market is the ``swap curve,'' which roughly represents funding rates among large financially sound banks. The difference between the Treasury yield and swap rate of the same maturity is known as the ``swap spread,'' and in theory reflects the premium for the banks' credit risk; this interpretation is sometimes strained when the spread becomes negative, but we'll leave this highly technical discussion for another day. The primary relevance of the swap curve to the discussion at hand is that large pools of fixed income securities are priced off of it, such as agency mortgage-backed securities and corporate bank loans, and are therefore also tightly linked to the Treasury curve when markets are calm and swap spreads are relatively constant.</p></div>
