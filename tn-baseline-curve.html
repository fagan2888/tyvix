        <div class="content editable"><h2>The anchor yield curve</h2><p>There are countless types of interest rates in the marketplace reflecting the diverse base of borrowers and activities being financed, and there's no universal cost of borrowing across individuals or institutions. From the lending perspective, however, the Treasury curve sets a baseline for the time value of money in the sense that it represents the return on a dollar with the lowest default and liquidity risk that's obtainable by all investors. It follows that the return on riskier lending should provide some premium over the equivalent Treasury yield, and this establishes a tight structural linkage between the Treasury curve and the yield on most fixed income assets.&nbsp;</p><p>%graphic: line plot of the Curves that I emailed to Yiding The Treasury can be purple, Swap green, and Corporate various shades of the blue/gray, just plot up to 10Y - YIDING<br />&nbsp;</p></div>
