    <h2 class="editable">Depth of the global financial crisis of 2007-8</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content editable"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the tumultuous months leading up to the Lehman Brothers in September 2008, equities (SPY) lost nearly 20% while Treasuries (IEF) gained about 8%. During the months following the historic event, the two portfolios diverged even more dramatically as the flight-to-quality trade kicked into high gear. Hundreds of billions drained out of prime money market funds and commercial paper and flowed into Treasury money market funds in droves as investors tried to shed as many risk assets as they could in a time of extreme uncertainty.</p><p>While asset prices diverged, clean implied volatilities of the two asset classes both spiked up, leading the familiar negative correlation between returns and volatility for equities but a less familiar positive correlation for Treasuries. This observation points to a potential application of VIX and TYVIX as compound market timing indicators for capturing the flight to quality trade; see the starred notes in the "TYVIX as a market timing indicator" section.</p></div>

    <h2 class="editable">Fear of a global slowdown at the start of 2016</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content editable"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Equity markets were off to a rocky start in 2016 with investor sentiment souring as oil prices continued to free fall and fears of a China slowdown took center stage in the financial press. While mild compared to the risk-off trade during the financial crisis, a 15% outperformance of IEF over SPY is still a significant gain to for any investor who managed to make a tactical switch into the safe haven asset.</p><p>See the starred notes in the "TYVIX as a market timing indicator" section for an example of an asset rotation strategy called Stabilis, which uses TYVIX and VIX as market timing indicators.</p></div>
