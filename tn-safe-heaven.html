            When too much borrowed money goes to wasteful consumption or counterproductive investments, and debtors become unable to repay, credit rears its darker side and sparks a deleveraging cycle like the one we experienced after the financial crisis of 2008.
            In a deleveraging cycle, lenders tighten credit, businesses and individuals spend less, asset prices fall, money drains out of the economy, and economic growth slows down. To manage the double-edged nature of credit, the Federal Reserve Bank
            (the “Fed”)–an independent but close consort of the Treasury Department–uses Treasuries as a primary tool for controlling the money supply to foster growth. The Fed is not the only central bank to use Treasuries as a key policy tool. Central
            banks around the world rely on Treasuries as the most common medium for maintaining foreign currency reserves to stabilize the value of their domestic currency as trade imbalances are in constant flux.
