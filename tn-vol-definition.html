    <h2 class="editable">Measuring Realized Volatility</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content editable"><p>The "realized volatility" is defined as the annualized standard deviation of historical returns of a certain asset, so it's called "realized". Take the SPY ETF as an example.&nbsp;</p><p>First we have a price series of SPY. &nbsp;We can see in the chart that the price of SPY does not always have the same level of volatility. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, SPY is definitely more volatile than the years before 2008. As a result, realized volatility depends on the historical data we are using. Based on different historical data, the realized volatility we can get is usually different.&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><p>Then we have a series of daily returns of SPY. We can see that the returns go up and down violently during the 2008 financial crisis, indicating that the realized volatility should be quite biggish during this period. This chart also reminds us of the famous assertion of volatility clustering in finance, as noted as Mandelbrot (1963), that "large changes tend to be followed by large changes, of either sign, and small changes tend to be followed by small changes." We can see in the chart that those very volatile periods tend to cluster together.&nbsp;<br />What this means in practice and in the world of investing is that as markets respond to new information with large price movements (volatility), these high-volatility environments tend to endure for a while after that first shock. In other words, when a market suffers a volatile shock, more volatility should be expected. This phenomenon has been referred to as the persistence of volatility shocks.&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><p>The annualized standard deviation is defined as the realized volatility of SPY. The following chart is a histogram of SPY daily returns. The standard deviation of SPY daily return is 1.21%, which means about 68% of the returns is between -1.21% and 1.21%. We can clearly see this from the histogram. Most returns are within the dash lines.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <h2 class="editable">Understanding Realized Volatility</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content editable"><p>Sometimes we may feel that realized volatility is not as straightforward as return. Intuitively, realized volatility measures how the returns are interspersed around the mean return. A larger realized volatility means that we will have returns far from the mean return more frequently in the past history. We can take a look at the return histogram of SPY and AGG ETF to understand how the realized volatility corporates with the distribution of returns.&nbsp;</p><p>The dashed lines in the chart marks -2 \(\times \) standard deviation and 2&nbsp;\(\times \) standard deviation. We can see that most of the returns are within the dashed lines. With the presumption that the returns follow a normal distribution, we can say that about 95% of returns are within the lines.&nbsp;<br /><br />The realized volatility of SPY is about much larger than the realized volatility of AGG, so we can see in the chart that the returns of AGG are much more concentrated than the returns of SPY, with about 95% between -0.63% and 0.63%. In addition, because the realized volatility of SPY is high, it is more likely to have some extreme return values when it come to SPY.&nbsp;</p></div>
