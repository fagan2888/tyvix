    <h2 class="editable">What is (realized) volatility?</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content editable"><p><br />The volatility of a financial security is commonly defined as the annualized standard deviation of its returns over a specific time period, also known as <em>realized</em> volatility.</p><p>To understand where this definition comes from, consider the price history of SPY (diversified large cap equities) and AGG (diversified investment grade bonds) in the chart to the right. A casual eyeball test tells us that the magnitude of daily price movements is not constant but varies significantly across both time and asset classes. &nbsp;For example, the price movement of SPY looks more pronounced than that of AGG, and seems particularly choppy during the global financial crisis of 2007-8. All else equal, investors prefer securities with smaller price swings as they pose less risk, and the definition of volatility attempts to quantify this aspect of securities prices.</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><p>When we see periods with "choppy" price movements, our eyes are identifying days when prices change significantly from one day to the next. To quantify this, we transform the daily price levels into daily price changes in percentages terms ("simple returns") for each day as shown to the right, which confirm and make more precise what our eyes observed from the price series above. First, both SPY and AGG cycle through periods with different amplitudes of price swings; moreover, the simple return chart reveals that days with higher amplitudes tend to cluster, which is an empirical phenomenon known as "volatility clustering." Second, the simple returns of SPY seem to be greater than those of AGG; however, this observation must be further quantified, which brings us to the next step.</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><p>Sometimes the price changes are big, sometimes they are small. It does not matter if one day's price change is large or small, the thing that investors concern is if the price changes are large or small <strong>overall</strong>. That's why we want to calculate the standard deviation of returns. From the histogram to the right, we can see that the standard deviation basically gives us an estimation of the interval where most of the returns are in. In this case we can have some ideas about how large the price movements are overall.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <h2 class="editable">Understanding Realized Volatility</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content editable"><p>Sometimes we may feel that realized volatility is not as straightforward as return. Intuitively, realized volatility measures how the returns are interspersed around the mean return. A larger realized volatility means that we have returns far from the mean return more frequently in the past history. We can take a look at the return histogram of SPY and AGG ETF to understand how the realized volatility corporates with the distribution of returns.&nbsp;<br /><br />The realized volatility of SPY is much larger than the realized volatility of AGG, so in the chart we can see that the returns of AGG are much more concentrated than the returns of SPY, with about 68% falling between -0.32% and 0.32%. In addition, because the realized volatility of SPY is high, it is more likely to have some extreme return values when it comes to SPY.&nbsp;</p><p>A low volatility usually means that investors can expect more stable returns from the asset, and protect them from suffering unexpected huge losses. As a result, given the same level of expected returns, the asset with lower volatility if usually preferred by the investors.&nbsp;</p></div>
