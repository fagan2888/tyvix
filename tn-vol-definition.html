    <h2 class="editable">What is (realized) volatility?</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content editable"><p><br />The volatility of a financial security is commonly defined as the annualized standard deviation of its returns over a specific time period, also known as <em>realized</em> volatility.</p><p>To understand where this definition comes from, consider the price history of SPY (diversified large cap equities) and AGG (diversified investment grade bonds) in the chart to the right. A casual eyeball test tells us that the magnitude of daily price movements is not constant but varies significantly across both time and asset classes. &nbsp;For example, the price movement of SPY looks more pronounced than that of AGG, and seems particularly choppy during the global financial crisis of 2007-8. All else equal, investors prefer securities with smaller price swings as they pose less risk, and the definition of volatility attempts to quantify this aspect of securities prices.</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><p>From the previous chart, we can see that daily price movement is critical to measuring the price swings. Usually investors use daily relative price movements, which is the daily price movements compared to previous day's price. Daily price movement divided by previous day's price is called daily simple return. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first step in quantifying price swings of assets is to calculate the simple returns. Simple return is the percentage change of price series. The line chart to the right plots the daily return series of SPY.&nbsp;</p><p>We can see that the returns go up and down violently during the 2008 financial crisis, which is consistent with the eyeball test. According to our definition, larger price moves can cause larger realized volatility. This chart also reminds us of the famous assertion of volatility clustering in finance, as noted as Mandelbrot (1963), that "large changes tend to be followed by large changes, of either sign, and small changes tend to be followed by small changes." We can see in the chart that those large returns tend to cluster together.</p><p>What this means in practice and in the world of investing is that as markets respond to new information with large price movements (volatility), these high-uncertainty environments tend to endure for a while after that first shock. In other words, when a market suffers a volatile shock, more volatility should be expected. This phenomenon has been referred to as the persistence of volatility shocks.&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><p>The annualized standard deviation is defined as the realized volatility of SPY. This chart in the right side is a histogram of SPY daily returns. The standard deviation of SPY daily return is 1.21%, which means about 68% of the returns are between -1.21% and 1.21%. We can clearly see this from the histogram. Most returns are within the dashed lines.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <h2 class="editable">Understanding Realized Volatility</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content editable"><p>Sometimes we may feel that realized volatility is not as straightforward as return. Intuitively, realized volatility measures how the returns are interspersed around the mean return. A larger realized volatility means that we will have returns far from the mean return more frequently in the past history. We can take a look at the return histogram of SPY and AGG ETF to understand how the realized volatility corporates with the distribution of returns.&nbsp;</p><p>The dashed lines in the chart marks -2 \(\times \) standard deviation and 2&nbsp;\(\times \) standard deviation. We can see that most of the returns are within the dashed lines. With the presumption that the returns follow a normal distribution, we can say that about 95% of returns are within the lines.&nbsp;<br /><br />The realized volatility of SPY is much larger than the realized volatility of AGG, so we can see in the chart that the returns of AGG are much more concentrated than the returns of SPY, with about 95% falling between -0.63% and 0.63%. In addition, because the realized volatility of SPY is high, it is more likely to have some extreme return values when it comes to SPY.&nbsp;</p><p>A low volatility usually means that investors can expect more stable returns from the asset, and protect them from suffering unexpected huge losses. As a result, given the same level of expected returns, the asset with lower volatility if usually preferred by the investors.&nbsp;</p></div>
