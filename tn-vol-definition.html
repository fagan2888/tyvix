    <h2 class="editable">What is (realized) volatility?</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content editable"><p><br />The volatility of a financial security is commonly defined as the annualized standard deviation of its returns over a specific time period, also known as <em>realized</em> volatility.</p><p>To understand where this definition comes from, consider the price history of SPY (diversified large cap equities) and AGG (diversified investment grade bonds) in the chart to the right. A casual eyeball test tells us that the magnitude of daily price movements is not constant but varies significantly across both time and asset classes. &nbsp;For example, the price movement of SPY looks more pronounced than that of AGG, and looks particularly choppy during the global financial crisis of 2007-8. All else equal, investors prefer securities with smaller price swings as they pose less risk, and the definition of volatility attempts to quantify this aspect of securities prices.</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><p>When we see periods with "choppy" price movements, our eyes are identifying days when prices change significantly from one day to the next. To quantify this, we transform the daily price levels into daily price changes in percentages terms ("simple returns") for each day as shown to the right, which confirm and make more precise what our eyes observed from the price series above. First, both SPY and AGG cycle through periods with different amplitudes of price swings; moreover, the simple return chart reveals that days with higher amplitudes tend to be bunched together, which is an empirical phenomenon known as "volatility clustering." Second, the simple returns of SPY appear to have higher amplitudes than those of AGG; however, this observation must be further quantified, which brings us to the next step.</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><p>The last step in defining the realized volatility of a financial security is to summarize the amplitude of simple returns into one number. In doing so, we sort all of the returns into bins to form the histogram to the right, which provides a sense of how they are distributed during this period, and ask "within what range do most of the returns fall?" The standard deviation of returns provides an answer to this question, which roughly gives the range in which two-thirds of the returns fall, and this finally explains the common definition of realized volatility.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few nuances to this calculation that influence the interpretation of the volatility number:</p><ol><li>the frequency of returns</li><li>the sample period of returns&nbsp;</li><li>annualized vs. non-annualized&nbsp;</li></ol><p>There is no theoretical guidance that tells us how to set the first two parameters, and investors must simply be attuned to their influences. As for the third parameter, it is generally useful to annualize the standard deviation to make apples-to-apples comparisons, but investors should also be cautious when comparing annualized volatilities calculated based on different return frequencies.</p><p>The two histograms to the right show that the volatility of SPY is about four times larger than that of AGG. This is consistent with the rough economic intuition that stocks, even large cap ones, are a riskier investments than high grade bonds because equity sits lower on the capital structure than debt.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><h3>Application: portfolio volatility and risk contributions</h3><p>We provide a simple example of how these volatility estimates may be useful in understanding the historical risk of toy portfolios containing different mixes of SPY and AGG.</p><p>This two-asset portfolio volatility may be decomposed as the square root of: $$\mathrm{Portfolio\; variance} = w_{SPY}^2 \sigma_{SPY}^2 + 2 \rho w_{SPY} w_{AGG} \sigma_{SPY} \sigma_{AGG} + w_{AGG}^2 \sigma_{AGG}^2$$ where \(w\) is the weight, \(\sigma\) is the volatility, and \(\rho\) is the correlation between the returns of AGG and SPY.</p><p>Moreover, the risk contribution of SPY to the portfolio may be calculated as: $$\mathrm{Risk \; contribution}_{SPY} = \frac{w_{SPY}^2 \sigma_{SPY}^2 + \rho w_{SPY} w_{AGG} \sigma_{SPY} \sigma_{AGG}} {\mathrm{Portfolio \; variance}}$$ and similarly for AGG.</p><p>The table to the right shows that a mix of 20% SPY and 80% AGG is close to "risk parity" in that their risk contributions are nearly equal.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p></div>
