Determine the option maturities required to calculate a 30-day variance</h3><ul><li>if the 1st month option is within one week to expiry, select the 2nd and 3rd month expiries</li><li>if the 1st month option has more than one week to expiry, select the 1st and 2nd month expiries</li><li>if the 1st month option has exactly 30 days to expiry, select only that expiry</li></ul><p class="present-before-paste">The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month options available on Nov 10, 2014 are the December, January, and February options:</p><p class="present-before-paste"><center><img alt="" width="500" height="97" src="/uploads/maturitychoice.svg" />&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="present-before-paste">Because the December option has 11 days left to expiry, we choose the December and January maturities as the near-term and next-term options.&nbsp;</p><h3>STEP 2. Determine the interest rate curve</h3><p class="present-before-paste">The TYVIX methodology uses interest rate data from the <a target="blank" href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=billRatesYear&amp;year=2014"> U.S. Department of the Treasury.&nbsp;</a>and fits a cubic spline through available term structure of interest rates to estimate. In our example, \(r_{\mathrm{near}} = 0.044\%\), \(r_{\mathrm{next}} = 0.035\%\). The rate data available on this day is as follows:&nbsp;</p><p class="present-before-paste"><center><img alt="" width="600" height="93" src="/uploads/ratedata.svg" /></p><h3>STEP 3. Determine the strikes to include in the calculation</h3><p class="present-before-paste">For each option maturity,&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Identify and include the ATM strike</li><li>Include OTM put strikes until there are two consecutive zero bids / cabinet trade prices (cabinet price is 0.001 in the data)</li><li>Include OTM call strikes until there are two consecutive zero bids / cabinet trade prices</li></ul><p><center><img alt="" width="600" height="462" src="/uploads/nearterm.svg" /></p><p class="present-before-paste">The procedure for determining the ATM strike is as follows:</p><ul><li>Calculate the mid-price of all included options by taking an average of the bid and ask prices.&nbsp;</li><li>Find the strike that minimizes the absolute difference between the put and call option prices.</li><li>Use this strike to identify the forward level F.</li></ul><p class="present-before-paste">Take the near-term option on Nov 10, 2014 as an example. As we can see in this table, 126.5 is the desired strike:</p><p class="present-before-paste"><center><img alt="" width="608" height="311" src="/uploads/neartermatm.svg" /></p><ul><li>Calculate the forward level F based on put-call parity: $$F = \mathrm{Strike \; price} + e^{rt} \times (\mathrm{Call \; price} - \mathrm{Put \; price})$$<br />For the near-term option on Jan 15, 2014, $$F_{\mathrm{near}} = 126.5 + (0.2969 - 0.5313) \times e^{rT_{\mathrm{near}}} = 126.27$$. The same for the next-term option, we can get the implied forward price 125.55.&nbsp;</li><li>Determine the ATM strike as the strike price immediately below F. &nbsp;In this example the ATM strikes for the near- and next-term options are 126 and 125.5, respectively. &nbsp;</li></ul><p class="present-before-paste">&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, the strikes to be included in the index calculation on Nov 10, 2014 are as follows:&nbsp;</p><p class="present-before-paste"><center><img alt="" width="676" height="498" src="/uploads/nearnextterm.svg" /></p><h3>STEP 4. &nbsp;Determine the clean implied variance for each option maturity</h3><p class="present-before-paste">$$\sigma ^ 2 = 2e^{r\tau}(\sum_{K_i} \frac{\Delta K_i}{K_i^2}P_{K_i}^{\mathrm{call}} + \sum_{K_j}\frac{\Delta K_j}{K_j^2}P_{K_j}^{\mathrm{put}}) - (\frac{F}{K_{\mathrm{ATM}}} - 1) ^ 2$$ where</p><ul><li><p class="present-before-paste">\(\sigma^2\) : Annualized clean implied variance between today and \(\tau\)</p></li><li>\(\Delta K\) : The distance between adjacent strikes</li><li>\(K_i, K_j\) : OTM call and put option strikes</li><li>\(K_{\mathrm{ATM}}\) : ATM strike</li><li>\(P_{K_i}^{call}, P_{K_j}^{put}\) : Call and put option prices</li><li>\(F\) : Implied forward price from STEP 3.</li></ul><p class="present-before-paste">The way to calculate \(\Delta K\) is given by: $$\Delta K_i = \frac{K_{i + 1} - K_{i - 1}}{2}$$ where,&nbsp;</p><ul><li>\(\Delta K_i\) : The \(\Delta K \; &nbsp;\mathrm{of \; ith \; strike}\)</li><li>\(K_{i + 1}, K_{i - 1}\) : The strike of \((i+1)\)th, \((i - 1)\)th option</li></ul><p class="present-before-paste">These numbers may be interpreted as the option-implied fair price of a contract known as a variance swap, which is a bet on the level of realized variance over a specific time period. This is the linkage that allows clean implied volatility--and in turn TYVIX--to be interpretated as the unique ``price of volatility''. In our example, $$\sigma^2_{near} = 3.81 \times 10^{-5} \times 2 \times e^{-0.044\% \times 0.0302} - (\frac{126.27}{126} - 1)^2 = 7.18 \times 10^{-5}$$, $$ \sigma^2_{next} = 9.33 \times 10^{-5} \times 2 \times e^{0.035\% \times 0.1261} - (\frac{125.55}{125.5} - 1)^2 = &nbsp;16.77\times 10^{-5}$$<br /><center><img alt="" width="800" height="400" src="/uploads/calculation.svg" /></p><h3 class="present-before-paste">STEP 5. Calculate the 30-day clean implied variance</h3><p class="present-before-paste">The variance we have got in step 4 is the implied variance for next 11 and 46 days, so we need to do a time-weighting to get the 30-day clean implied variance: $$\sigma_{30 \mathrm{Days}} ^ 2 = &nbsp;\frac{T_{\mathrm{next}} - T_0}{T_{\mathrm{next}} - T_{\mathrm{near}}} \sigma_{near}^2 + \frac{T_0 - T_{\mathrm{near}}}{T_{\mathrm{next}} - T_{\mathrm{near}}} \sigma_{next}^2$$ where,&nbsp;</p><ul><li>\(\sigma_{30 \mathrm{Days}}^2\) : The 30-day clean implied variance</li><li>\(\sigma_{\mathrm{near}}^2, \sigma_{\mathrm{next}}^2\) : The monthly clean implied variance of near-term / next-term options</li><li>\(T_{\mathrm{next}}, T_{\mathrm{near}}\) : The time (minutes) to maturity of near-term / next-term options</li><li>\(T_0\) : The time (minutes) contained in one month (assume 30 days in a month)</li></ul><p class="present-before-paste">The formula to calculate \(T_{\mathrm{next}}, T_{\mathrm{near}}\) is given by: $$T = (M_{\mathrm{Current} &nbsp;\; \mathrm{day}} + M_{\mathrm{Settlement} &nbsp;\; \mathrm{day}} + M_{\mathrm{Other} &nbsp;\; \mathrm{days}}) / \mathrm{Minutes &nbsp;\; in \; a \; year}$$ where,&nbsp;</p><ul><li>\(M_{\mathrm{Current} &nbsp;\; \mathrm{day}}\) : The minutes left on current day</li><li>\(M_{\mathrm{Settlement} &nbsp;\; \mathrm{day}}\) : The minutes included on settlement day</li><li>\(M_{\mathrm{Other} &nbsp;\; \mathrm{days}}\) : The minutes included on regular days</li></ul><p class="present-before-paste">In our example, assuming that we want to calculate the closing TYVIX of Nov 10, 2014, then \(T_{near} = 11 \; \mathrm{Days} = 15855 \; \mathrm{Mins}\), \(T_{next} = 46&nbsp; \; \mathrm{Days} = 66285 \; \mathrm{Mins}\). So the square of 30-day clean implied volatility is: $$\sigma_{30\mathrm{Days}}^2 = \frac{66285 - 43200}{66285 - 15855} \times 7.18 \times 10^{-5} + \frac{43200 - 15855}{66285 - 15855} \times 16.77\times 10^{-5} = &nbsp;21.46\times 10^{-5}$$</p><h3 class="present-before-paste">STEP 6. Annualize the result</h3><p class="present-before-paste">TYVIX index is the percentage number of annualized 30-day clean implied volatility, so we need to annualize it and scale it by 100, $$\mathrm{TYVIX} = 100 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{365}{30} \sigma_{\mathrm{30Days}}^2}$$, In our example, \(\mathrm{TYVIX} = 5.11\).&nbsp;</p><p class="present-before-paste">Extra technical notes:</p><ol><li>Maturity mismatch: the variance pricing theory requires the maturity of the options and underlying futures to coincide, but CBOT's contract listing schedule does not conform to this assumption. The original VIX methodology is silent on this issue as it does not arise in the case of S&amp;P 500 options.</li><li>Option exercise style: the variance pricing theory requires the options to have European-style exercise, but CBOT's TY options have American-style exercise.</li><li>The procedure for identifying the ATM strike through calculating an implied forward value and invoking put-call parity is not strictly necessary since TY futures prices are directly observable and the ATM strike can simply be defined as the strike closest to the futures price. The procedure is a remnant of the original VIX methodology for SPX options.<br />&nbsp;</li></ol><p class="present-before-paste">We have conducted empirical tests to show that the numerical impact of these two approximations is negligible given the short maturities used in the calculation of TYVIX.
