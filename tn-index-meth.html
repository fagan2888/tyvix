TYVIX methodology uses the interest rate data from U.S. Department of the Treasury.&nbsp;<br />The interest rate curve is calculated based on a cubic spline of the available interest rate data. In our example, \(r_{\mathrm{near}} = -0.017\%\), \(r_{\mathrm{next}} = 1.481\%\).&nbsp;</p><p>3. for each option maturity, determine the set of strikes to include in the calculation<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) identify and include the ATM strike (see the following methodology)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) include OTM put strikes until there are two consecutive zero bids<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(c) include OTM call strikes until there are two consecutive zero bids<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ### add chart; How can we exclude the 0-bid options.</p><p><img alt="" src="/uploads/nearterm.svg" width="400" height="308" />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The methodology of determining the ATM strike is as follows:</p><ul><li>calculate the mid-price of call options and put options. Here mid-price is the average of ask price and bid price.&nbsp;</li><li>Find out the strike in which the absolute difference between call option price and put option price is smallest. This strike is used to calculate the forward level F. Take the near-term option on Jan 15, 2014 as an example. As we can see in the table, 124 is the desired strike.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;###add figure: how to determine the ATM strikes</p><ul><li>Calculate the forward level F: $$F = \mathrm{Strike \; price} + e^{rt} \times (\mathrm{Call \; price} - \mathrm{Put \; price})$$ For the near-term option on Jan 15, 2014, \(F_{\mathrm{near}} = 124 + (0.2969 - 0.3359) \times e^{rT_{\mathrm{near}}}\).<br />In the formula, \(r = r_{\mathrm{near}} = -0.017\%\), \(T_{\mathrm{near}} = 13140 / 525600 = 0.025\), so \(F_{\mathrm{near}} = 123.96\).&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, determine the ATM strike. ATM strike here is defined as the strike price immediately below the forward level F. For the near-term option on Jan 15, 2014, the ATM strike is 123.5. For the next-term option, the ATM strike is also 123.5. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The strikes we will include in the calculation for the near-term and next term option on Jan 15, 2014 are as follows:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ### add figure: All the strikes we want to include.</p><p>4. &nbsp;for each option maturity, determine the clean implied variance $$\sigma ^ 2 = 2e^{r\tau}(\sum_{K_i} \frac{\Delta K_i}{K_i^2}P_{K_i}^{\mathrm{call}} + \sum_{K_j}\frac{\Delta K_j}{K_j^2}P_{K_j}^{\mathrm{put}}) - (\frac{F}{K_{\mathrm{ATM}}} - 1) ^ 2$$, where</p><ul><li>\(\sigma^2\) : The monthly clean implied variance</li><li>\(\Delta K\) : The difference between adjacent strikes</li><li>\(K_i, K_j\) : Call option strikes and put option strikes</li><li>\(K_{\mathrm{ATM}}\) : At-the-money strike</li><li>\(P_{K_i}^{call}, P_{K_j}^{put}\) : Call option prices and put option prices</li><li>\(F\) : The underlying future price</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The way to calculate \(\Delta K\) is given by: $$\Delta K_i = \frac{K_{i + 1} - K_{i - 1}}{2}$$, where,&nbsp;</p><ul><li>\(\Delta K_i\) : The \(\Delta K \; &nbsp;\mathrm{of \; ith \; strike}\)</li><li>\(K_{i + 1}, K_{i - 1}\) : The strike of \((i+1)\)th, \((i - 1)\)th option</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;These numbers may be interpreted as the option-implied fair price of a contract known as a variance swap, which is a bet on the level of realized variance over a specific time period. This is the linkage that allows clean implied volatility--and in turn TYVIX--to be interpretated as the unique ``price of volatility''. In our example, $$\sigma^2_{near} = 2.94 \times 10^{-5} \times 2 \times e^{-0.017\% \times 0.0250} - (\frac{123.96}{123.5} - 1)^2 = 4.49 \times 10^{-5}$$, $$ \sigma^2_{next} = 12.92 \times 10^{-5} \times 2 \times e^{1.48\% \times 0.1017} - (\frac{123.97}{123.5} - 1)^2 = 24.43 \times 10^{-5}$$<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ## insert chart: the calculation process.&nbsp;</p><p>5. calculate the 30-day clean implied variance by time weighting, $$\sigma_{30 \mathrm{Days}} ^ 2 = &nbsp;\frac{T_{\mathrm{next}} - T_0}{T_{\mathrm{next}} - T_{\mathrm{near}}} \sigma_{near}^2 + \frac{T_0 - T_{\mathrm{near}}}{T_{\mathrm{next}} - T_{\mathrm{near}}} \sigma_{next}^2$$, where,&nbsp;</p><ul><li>\(\sigma_{30Days}^2\) : The 30-day clean implied variance</li><li>\(\sigma_{\mathrm{near}}^2, \sigma_{\mathrm{next}}^2\) : The monthly clean implied variance of near-term / next-term options</li><li>\(T_{\mathrm{next}}, T_{\mathrm{near}}\) : The time (minutes) to maturity of near-term / next-term options</li><li>\(T_0\) : The time (minutes) contained in one month (assume 30 days in a month)</li></ul><p>The formula to calculate $T_{\mathrm{next}}, T_{\mathrm{near}}$ is given by: $$T = (M_{\mathrm{Current} &nbsp;\; \mathrm{day}} + M_{\mathrm{Settlement} &nbsp;\; \mathrm{day}} + M_{\mathrm{Other} &nbsp;\; \mathrm{days}}) / \mathrm{Minutes &nbsp;\; in \; a \; year}$$, where,&nbsp;</p><ul><li>\(M_{\mathrm{Current} &nbsp;\; \mathrm{day}}\) : The minutes left on current day</li><li>\(M_{\mathrm{Settlement} &nbsp;\; \mathrm{day}}\) : The minutes included on settlement day</li><li>\(M_{\mathrm{Other} &nbsp;\; \mathrm{days}}\) : The minutes included on regular days</li></ul><p>In our example, assuming that we want to calculate the closing TYVIX of Jan 15, 2014, then \(T_{near} = 9 \; \mathrm{Days} = 13140\), \(T_{next} = 37 &nbsp;\; \mathrm{Days} = 53460\). So the square of 30-day clean implied volatility is: $$\sigma_{30 \; Days}^2 = \frac{53460 - 43200}{53460 - 13140} \times 4.49 \times 10^{-5} + \frac{43200 - 13140}{53460 - 13140} \times 24.43\times 10^{-5} = 19.43 \times 10^{-5}$$</p><p>6. calculate the 30-day clean implied volatility and scale by 100, $$\mathrm{TYVIX} = 100 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{365}{30} \sigma_{\mathrm{30Days}}^2}$$, In our example, \(\mathrm{TYVIX} = 4.86\).&nbsp;</p><p>Extra technical notes:</p><ol><li>Maturity mismatch: the variance pricing theory requires the maturity of the options and underlying futures to coincide, but CBOT's contract listing schedule does not conform to this assumption. The original VIX methodology is silent on this issue as it does not arise in the case of S&amp;P 500 options.</li><li>Option exercise style: the variance pricing theory requires the options to have European-style exercise, but CBOT's TY options have American-style exercise.<br />&nbsp;</li></ol><p>We have conducted empirical tests to show that the numerical impact of these two approximations is negligible given the short maturities used in the calculation of TYVIX.
