        <div class="content editable"><h3>Diversification through security selection</h3><p>Diversification is arguably the most foundational volatility reduction technique adopted by investors. However, one of the core challenges of reducing volatility through diversification through security selection is that the relationship between returns on securities within the same asset class is not constant over time, and may break down just when markets start to become volatile. The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 highlighted this danger when correlations across many assets spiked dramatically and supposedly well-diversified portfolios suddenly became more exposed to directional market risk.</p><p>Here's nice paper on fund performance and correlation risk:<br /><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1639984">Buraschi, A., Kosowski, R., Trojani, F.
