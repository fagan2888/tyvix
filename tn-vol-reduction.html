        <div class="content editable"><h3>Diversification through security selection</h3><p>Diversification is arguably the most foundational volatility reduction technique adopted by investors. However, one of the core challenges of reducing volatility through diversification through security selection is that the relationship between returns on securities within the same asset class is not constant over time, and may break down just when markets start to become volatile. The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 highlighted this danger when correlations across many assets spiked dramatically and supposedly well-diversified portfolios suddenly became more exposed to directional market risk.</p><p>Here's nice paper on fund performance and correlation risk:<br /><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1639984">Buraschi, A., Kosowski, R., Trojani, F.

        <div class="content editable"><h3>Diversification through asset allocation</h3><p>Asset allocation is a higher-level diversification exercise than intra-asset class security selection, in which investors first decide how to allocate capital across various traditional asset classes, such as equities and bonds, as well as alternative asset classes, such as private equity funds and real estate. Examples of well-known asset allocation frameworks include simple static allocations (e.g. the 60 / 40 rule), risk parity, and liability-driven investments. It's not tough to guess that a 60/40 portfolio has experienced some major ups and downs, but the return chart here shows that even a&nbsp;risk parity fund like AQRIX experiences bouts of volatility and drawdowns.</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><h3>"Low volatility" products</h3><p>Major index providers such as S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI have introduced modifications of their benchmark equity indexes that are designed to have lower volatility by putting more weight on stocks that have experienced lower volatility in the past. The jury's still out on whether the implicit assumption that selecting and weighting stocks based on past volatility helps achieve lower future volatility, but these products have attracted significant assets under management since the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, presumably in part as a reaction to the emotional and financial distress caused by the price swings during the crisis.</p></div>
