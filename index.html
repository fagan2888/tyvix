        <div class="editable content"><p>We were once asked by a rather brash, albeit admittedly bright, young portfolio manager why anyone should care about TYVIX, an index of US Treasury volatility that we helped Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) create. Until then, we had had no difficulty discussing intricate applications of the index in over a hundred meetings with sophisticated traders, but we found ourselves unable to articulate an incisive answer to this most basic question.</p><p>As it happens too often in finance, we had mistaken our fluency in complex and technical matters for a genuine grasp of underlying economic fundamentals, so we needed to bite the bullet and go back to basics. This site chronicles our humble journey to rebuild our mental model of volatility in fixed income markets from the ground up in the hopes of bringing further depth to the exchange of ideas around TYVIX.<img class="star" alt="index_methodology" src="imgs/star.png" /></p></div>

          <h2>Volatility hasn’t always been so accessible</h2>
          Besides the small coterie of derivatives wizards who could trade options in their sleep, most investors have traditionally viewed volatility as a nuisance in their portfolio that needs to be minded and, in theory, managed. We say “in theory” because controlling portfolio volatility is in fact a formidable task, and neither foundational volatility reduction techniques   nor third party products are impervious to all market conditions. Some historical attempts to rein in volatility have even backfired quite infamously, and the jury’s still out on their modern day reincarnates like tail risk funds
    • Diversification 
    • Asset allocation (60/40, risk parity, etc.) 
    • Low vol products (lowvol, minvol, etc.) 
    • Tail risk products 
    • Portfolio insurance
