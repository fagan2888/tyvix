                <p>We were once asked by a rather brash, albeit admittedly bright, young portfolio manager why anyone should care about TYVIX, an index of US Treasury volatility that we helped Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) create. Until then, we
                    had had no difficulty discussing intricate applications of the index in over a hundred meetings with sophisticated traders, but we found ourselves unable to articulate an incisive answer to this most basic question.</p>
                <p>As it happens too often in finance, we had mistaken our fluency in complex and technical matters for a genuine grasp of underlying economic fundamentals, so we needed to bite the bullet and go back to basics. This site chronicles our humble
                    journey to rebuild our mental model of volatility in fixed income markets from the ground up in the hopes of bringing further depth to the exchange of ideas around TYVIX.<img class="star" alt="index_methodology" src="imgs/star.png"

                <h2>Volatility hasn’t always been so accessible</h2> Besides the small coterie of derivatives wizards who could trade options in their sleep, most investors have traditionally viewed volatility as a nuisance in their portfolio that needs to be minded and, in theory, managed. We say “in
                theory” because controlling portfolio volatility is in fact a formidable task, and neither foundational volatility reduction techniques nor third party products are impervious to all market conditions. Some historical attempts to rein
                in volatility have even backfired quite infamously, and the jury’s still out on their modern day reincarnates like tail risk funds • Diversification • Asset allocation (60/40, risk parity, etc.) • Low vol products (lowvol, minvol, etc.)
                • Tail risk products • Portfolio insurance

            <div class="content editable">
                <p>US Treasuries are debt securities issued by the US Department of the Treasury to help finance activities undertaken by the government, such as defense and Social Security, and to fuel economic growth by putting credit to productive use,
                    such as funding research and innovation. Once they begin trading in secondary markets, Treasuries go well beyond their primary raisons d’etre to perform numerous ancillary functions that are critical to the workings of the global financial
                    system. Each of these facets brings about mechanisms through which Treasury volatility reverbrates worldwide to affect most investors with varying degrees of subtlety. Graphic: pie chart of Tsy holdings </p>
                <h2>A benchmark interest rate for US Dollars</h2>
                <p>Arguably the most far-reaching ancillary function of Treasury term structure is to set a baseline for the time value of money used to discount future cashflows. As most financial securities may be valued as a discounted stream of contingent
                    future payments, it stands to reason that changes in the Treasury curve affects practically all securities under the sun, some more obviously than others. Graphic: graph of a Tsy curve </p>
                <p>As a very direct example, bonds issued by credit-worthy entities, such as companies we all know like IBM and John Deere, are quoted and traded as a spread to duration-matched benchmark Treasury yields. Other types of securities affected
                    by the Treasury curve include: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Corporate bonds </li>
                    <li>Municipal bonds </li>
                    <li>Callable bonds </li>
                    <li>Emerging market bonds</li>
                    <li>Agency mortgages </li>
                    <li>Interest rate-sensitive equities</li>
                    <li>Treasuries and TIPS </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>

A tool for monetary policy the world over</h2>
                <p>When too much borrowed money goes to wasteful consumption or counterproductive investments, and debtors become unable to repay, credit rears its darker side and sparks a deleveraging cycle like the one we experienced after the financial
                    crisis of 2008. In a deleveraging cycle, lenders tighten credit, businesses and individuals spend less, asset prices fall, money drains out of the economy, and economic growth slows down. To manage the double-edged nature of credit,
                    the Federal Reserve Bank (the “Fed”)–an independent but close consort of the Treasury Department–uses Treasuries as a primary tool for controlling the money supply to foster growth. The Fed is not the only central bank to use Treasuries
                    as a key policy tool. Central banks around the world rely on Treasuries as the most common medium for maintaining foreign currency reserves to stabilize the value of their domestic currency as trade imbalances are in constant flux.</p>
                <h2>A cornerstone of short-term liquidity</h2>
                <p>A more esoteric yet equally vital ancillary fuction of Treasuries is to serve as collateral for short-term funding for routine transactions lubricating financial markets. An ever-changing supply of cash comes from individuals and institutions
                    looking to earn interest on idle cash while maintaining ready access to it, and an equally persistent yet variable demand for cash comes from dealers and investors looking for cheap on-demand leverage to finance securities holdings
                    and other transactions. The key lubricant for matching this fluid supply and demand for cash is a uniquely high-quality, liquid, and standardized collateral: Treasuries.</p>
                <h2>A safe haven asset</h2>
                <p>
                    Treasuries have a unique de facto designation as the “safe haven asset” in US markets. This is not an intentional role served by Treasuries; rather, it stems from the historical experience that investors flock to Treasuries as the surest way to preserve
                    capital during market panics when fear and uncertainty reign supreme. This “flight to quality” phenomenon can lead to peculiar incidences wherein Treasury prices increase with investor risk aversion, which in turn buttresses–somewhat
                    paraxodically–the performance of riskier securities like corporate bonds. This dynamic is likely to be new to those only familiar with equity market volatility. Graphic: TY vs. SPY during Lehman </p>
