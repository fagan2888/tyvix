          We were once asked by a rather brash, albeit admittedly bright, young portfolio manager why anyone should care about TYVIX, an index of US Treasury volatility that we helped Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) create. Until then, we had had no difficulty discussing intricate applications of the index in over a hundred meetings with sophisticated traders, but we found ourselves unable to articulate an incisive answer to this most basic question.
As it happens too often in finance, we had mistaken our fluency in complex and technical matters for a genuine grasp of underlying economic fundamentals, so we needed to bite the bullet and go back to basics. This site chronicles our humble journey to rebuild our mental model of volatility in fixed income markets from the ground up in the hopes of bringing further depth to the exchange of ideas around TYVIX.
