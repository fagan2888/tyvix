            When too much borrowed money goes to wasteful consumption or counterproductive investments, and debtors become unable to repay, credit rears its darker side and sparks a deleveraging cycle like the one we experienced after the financial crisis of 2008.
            In a deleveraging cycle, lenders tighten credit, businesses and individuals spend less, asset prices fall, money drains out of the economy, and economic growth slows down. To manage the double-edged nature of credit, the Federal Reserve Bank
            (the “Fed”)–an independent but close consort of the Treasury Department–uses Treasuries as a primary tool for controlling the money supply to foster growth. The Fed is not the only central bank to use Treasuries as a key policy tool. Central
            banks around the world rely on Treasuries as the most common medium for maintaining foreign currency reserves to stabilize the value of their domestic currency as trade imbalances are in constant flux.

    <h2 class="editable">Pricing of TYVIX futures</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content editable"><p>Like what we have discussed before, TYVIX futures are cashed settled so we can't use the non-arbitrage argument to price TYVIX futures. Here we use a methodology based on the works of Carr and Wu (2006) and Dupire (2006), which rely on the key principle that variance is additive in time. Consider, for example, the realized variance of T-Note future returns over the next two months:<br />$$\text{Realized variance}\left( 0,2\right) =\text{Realized variance}\left(0,1\right) +\text{Realized variance}\left( 1,2\right) $$<br />This is simply the sum of two variances: the variance occurring in the first month plus that occurring in the second month. By re-arranging terms<br />and annualizing,<br />$$\frac{\text{Realized variance}\left( 1,2\right) }{1/12}=2\times \frac{\text{Realized variance}\left( 0,2\right) }{2/12}-\frac{\text{Realized variance}\left( 0,1\right) }{1/12}$$</p></div>
