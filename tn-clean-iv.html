    <h2 class="editable">Clean Implied Volatility</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content editable"><p>To understand the risk premium component of clean implied volatility, consider medical insurance in the United States: healthy individuals do not expect to spend more per year than the cost of routine check-ups, but commonly pay a greater amount in insurance premiums to avoid being liable for cirpplingly large unexpected medical bills. The cost of insurance can therefore be decomposed into how much one actually expects to spend on doctors plus a risk premium for protection from the unexpected.</p><p>In a similar spirit, clean implied volatility may be interpreted as the market-determined price of a policy that pays out $1 for every 1% in volatility realized over a given horizon. Because volatility spikes are associated with market turmoil and investment losses, the average investor is willing to pay more for such a policy than the volatility actually expected during its term. TYVIX represents the fair market "price'' of insuring against volatility realized by TY over the coming 30 days, i.e., the fair strike of a variance swap on TY.</p><p><strong></strong><strong></strong>The chart to the right plots the level of TYVIX overlaid with TY volatility realized over the subsequent 30 days and the difference between the two. In the medical insurance analogy, TYVIX being higher than realized volatility corresponds to the case in which the medical bills incurred were less than the cost of insurance, and vice-versa. This <em>ex post</em>&nbsp;difference is often called the "volatility risk premium'' in both industry and academia, which is a slight abuse of terminology since the risk premium is an <em>ex ante</em>&nbsp;concept and is not directly observable; the correct interpretation of this difference is the realized payoff of having purchased insurance. Looking at it another way, the bar chart showing the differences could be interpreted as the historical payoff profile of volatility swaps on TY.</p><p>Option writing strategies, such as programmatically selling puts on the S&amp;P 500, are based on a closely related concept of risk premiums in individual options prices. The medical insurance analogy could be applied here as well: option prices can be decomposed into how much the buyer actually expects the option to pay out plus a risk premium for outsized payouts.&nbsp;</p></div>
