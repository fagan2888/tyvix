For example, during the "QE taper tantrum" of summer 2013, TYVIX spiked as bond investors became concerned about the timing and impact of an impending policy shift, whereas VIX barely reacted as equity investors seemingly shrugged it off. Extrapolating from the observation that an uptrend in these indexes may herald a period of heightened risk and downside potential in their respective markets, TYVIX and VIX may be useful as complementary indicators for assessing the relative level of perceived risk in bond and equity markets.</p><p>[INSERT FIGURES]</p><h3>Application example: Stabilis Index</h3><p>Stabilis a strategy index that is designed to track a hypothetical portfolio with diversified equity and bond exposures that allocates capital to assets that are likely to perform well in different volatility environments. The strategy allocates across four different assets:</p><ul><li>SPY: an ETF tracking the performance of the S&amp;P 500 total return index.&nbsp;</li><li>AGG: an ETF tracking the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.&nbsp;</li><li>IEF: an ETF tracking the Barclays U.S. 7-10 Year Treasury Bond Index.&nbsp;</li><li>Cash: represented by Federal Funds Target Rates index.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The strategy classifies four volatility regimes based on the levels of TYVIX and VIX compared to their past six months:&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="430" height="220" src="/uploads/stabilissignal.svg" /></center><p>Historically, we observe that&nbsp;</p><ul><li>risk assets tend to perform well during broad market calm</li><li>the most severe risk asset drawdowns tend to happen during broad market panic</li><li>equities tend to underperform and there's a flight-to-quality into Treasuries in a broad market panic</li><li>bonds tend to underperform equities when there&rsquo;s isolated anxiety in bond markets&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The empirical observations above serve as building blocks for the following allocation rule:&nbsp;</p><center>&nbsp;</center><center><img alt="" width="472" height="458" src="/uploads/tyvix asset rot strat deck1.svg" /></center><p>The backtested cumulative returns shown below demonstrate that the strategy succeeds in smoothing out major drawdowns compared to a 60/40 benchmark:&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="1067" height="347" src="/uploads/stabiliscumret3.svg" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="700" height="179" src="/uploads/stabilisperformance.svg" /></center></div>
