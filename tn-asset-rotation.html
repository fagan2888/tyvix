Such kind of volatility index is commonly considered to have some prediction power.&nbsp;</p><p>2. VIX is used as market-timing indicators. Example: the MS product.&nbsp;</p><h3>How TYVIX differs from VIX</h3><p>Like VIX, TYVIX is also an index measures implied volatility for the future 30 days, but for fixed-income markets. This part should focuses on the "difference" between TYVIX and VIX index.&nbsp;</p><p>[FIG: examples of the extra information we can get from TYVIX and VIX. For example, the equity market rally in post-crisis period; the QE taper tantrum]&nbsp;</p><h3>How TYVIX can corporate with VIX to serve as market timing indicators</h3><p>From previous sections, we know that VIX index is a risk indicator of the equity market, and TYVIX is a risk indicator of the fixed income market. In this case, when TYVIX corporates with VIX as market timing indicators, we can get more information than only using VIX or TYVIX itself. We try to illustrate this point using an asset rotation strategy we have proposed called Stabilis.&nbsp;</p><p>Stabilis is designed to provide diversified equity and bond exposures, and allocate capital to assets that are likely to perform well in current volatility environments and risk appetites. The strategy defines four different market scenarios according to the information we can get from TYVIX and VIX indices, which is listed in the following table:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="430" height="220" src="/uploads/stabilissignal.svg" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These four scenarios indicate different volatility environments of the market:</p><ul><li>TYVIX high, VIX high: Both of the volatility indices are high, indicating that there is a turmoil in the broad financial market, which can be interpreted as "flight-to-quality" or "risk-off" regimes.&nbsp;</li><li>TYVIX high, VIX low: TYVIX is high, VIX is low, which indicates that there is some fixed income market specific risk.&nbsp;</li><li>TYVIX low, VIX high: TYVIX is low, VIX is high, which indicates that there is some equity market specific risk.</li><li>TYVIX low, VIX low: Both of the volatility indices are low, indicating that the market is calm and there is no big drawdown expected, which can be interpreted as "risk-on" regimes.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Based on our understanding of these 4 scenarios, we allocate different weights to the following assets accordingly:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
