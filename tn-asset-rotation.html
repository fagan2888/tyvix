For example, during the "QE taper tantrum" of summer 2013, TYVIX spiked as bond investors became concerned about the timing and impact of an impending policy shift, whereas VIX barely reacted as equity investors seemingly shrugged it off. Extrapolating from the observation that an uptrend in these indexes may herald a period of heightened risk and downside potential in their respective markets, TYVIX and VIX may be useful as complementary indicators for assessing the relative level of perceived risk in bond and equity markets.</p><p>[INSERT FIGURES]</p><h3>Application example: Stabilis Index</h3><p>Stabilis a strategy index that is designed to track a hypothetical portfolio with diversified equity and bond exposures that allocates capital to assets that are likely to perform well in different volatility environments. The strategy allocates across four different assets:</p><ul><li>SPY: an ETF tracking the performance of the S&amp;P 500 total return index.&nbsp;</li><li>AGG: an ETF tracking the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.&nbsp;</li><li>IEF: an ETF tracking the Barclays U.S. 7-10 Year Treasury Bond Index.&nbsp;</li><li>Cash: represented by Federal Funds Target Rates index.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The strategy classifies four volatility regimes based on the levels of TYVIX and VIX compared to their past six months:&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="430" height="220" src="/uploads/stabilissignal.svg" /></center><p>According to our study of the historical performance, we have following empirical building blocks:</p><ul><li>Risk assets perform well during broad market calm.</li><li>Bonds significantly underperform equities when there&rsquo;s isolated anxiety in bond markets.</li><li>The most severe risk asset drawdowns happen during broad market panics.&nbsp;</li><li>Equities underperform and there's a flight-to-quality into Treasuries in a broad market panic.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>These empirical building blocks inspired us of the weight table of asset allocation for different regimes.&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="472" height="458" src="/uploads/tyvix asset rot strat deck1.svg" /></center><p>This asset rotation strategy has a very good historical performance in backtest, the following is the non-compounded cumulative return chart: &nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="1067" height="347" src="/uploads/stabiliscumret3.svg" /></center><p>If we look into the performance table, we can find that Stabilis has a much higher risk-adjusted return than the 60 / 40 benchmark or AGG itself. In addition, the maximum drawdown of Stabilis is much smaller than other assets.&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="700" height="179" src="/uploads/stabilisperformance.svg" /></center></div>
