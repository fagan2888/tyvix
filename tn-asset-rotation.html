Such kind of volatility index is commonly considered to have some prediction power.&nbsp;</p><p>2. VIX is used as market-timing indicators.

This part should focuses on the "difference" between TYVIX and VIX index.&nbsp;</p><p>[FIG: examples of the extra information we can get from TYVIX and VIX.

In this case, when TYVIX corporates with VIX as market timing indicators, we can get more information than only using VIX or TYVIX itself. We try to illustrate this point using an asset rotation strategy we have proposed called Stabilis.&nbsp;</p><p>Stabilis is designed to provide diversified equity and bond exposures, and allocate capital to assets that are likely to perform well in current volatility environments and risk appetites. The strategy defines four different market scenarios according to the information we can get from TYVIX and VIX indices.&nbsp;</p><p>[Stabilis historical performance]</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
