Clean implied volatility conveys market expectations regarding the level of impending uncertainty in the underlying security returns, and an uptrend in implied volatility may herald a period of heightened risk and downside potential.</p><p>There have been some asset rotation products using VIX as a market timing signal already available on the market. For example, Barclays S&amp;P VEQTOR ETN (VEQTOR) and Morgan Stanley High Yield Index. VEQTOR use VIX index and SPX realized volatility as market timing signals to determine the allocation weight between S&amp;P 500 and VIX short term futures, while Morgan Stanley High Yield Index uses VIX index as a market timing signal to determine the asset allocation between HYG (iShares iBoxx H/Y Corporate Bond Fund) and TLT (iShares Barclays 20+ Year Treasury Bond Fund).&nbsp;</p><h3>How TYVIX differs from VIX in market timing</h3><p>TYVIX and VIX are both indices that measure implied volatility for the future 30 days, but TYVIX is for fixed-income markets while VIX is for equity markets. There are certain time periods that we have fixed-income specified risk in the financial market.&nbsp;</p><p>One example is the equity market rally in post-crisis period in 2009. When the investors were selling their bonds and returning to more risky asset at the end of the crisis, there was big spike in TYVIX index while nothing in VIX index.&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="534" height="520" src="/uploads/chartequityrally.svg" /></center><p>The other example is the QE taper tantrum in 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>[FIG: TYVIX &amp; VIX in this time period]</p><h3>How TYVIX can corporate with VIX to serve as market timing indicators</h3><p>From previous sections, we know that VIX index is a risk indicator of the equity market, and TYVIX is a risk indicator of the fixed income market. In this case, when TYVIX corporates with VIX as market timing indicators, we can get more information than only using VIX or TYVIX itself. We try to illustrate this point using an asset rotation strategy we have proposed called Stabilis.&nbsp;</p><p>Stabilis is designed to provide diversified equity and bond exposures, and allocate capital to assets that are likely to perform well in current volatility environments and risk appetites. It mainly invests in four different assets:</p><ul><li>SPY: SPY ETF tracks the performance of the S&amp;P 500 total return index.&nbsp;</li><li>AGG: AGG ETF is the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.&nbsp;</li><li>IEF: IEF ETF is the Barclays U.S. 7-10 Year Treasury Bond Index.&nbsp;</li><li>Cash: Sometimes the strategy may parks at cash and cash return is represented by Federal Funds Target Rates index.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The strategy defines four different market scenarios according to the information we can get from TYVIX and VIX indices, which is listed in the following table:&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="430" height="220" src="/uploads/stabilissignal.svg" /></center><p>These four scenarios indicate different volatility environments of the market, historically:</p><ul><li>TYVIX high, VIX high: Both of the volatility indices are high, indicating that there is a turmoil in the broad financial market, which can be interpreted as "flight-to-quality" or "risk-off" regimes.&nbsp;</li><li>TYVIX high, VIX low: TYVIX is high, VIX is low, which indicates that there is some fixed income market specific risk.&nbsp;</li><li>TYVIX low, VIX high: TYVIX is low, VIX is high, which indicates that there is some equity market specific risk.</li><li>TYVIX low, VIX low: Both of the volatility indices are low, indicating that the market is calm and there is no big drawdown expected, which can be interpreted as "risk-on" regimes.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>According to our study of the historical performance, we have following empirical building blocks:</p><ul><li>Risk assets perform well during broad market calm.</li><li>Bonds significantly underperform equities when there&rsquo;s isolated anxiety in bond markets.</li><li>The most severe risk asset drawdowns happen during broad market panics.&nbsp;</li><li>Equities underperform and there's a flight-to-quality into Treasuries in a broad market panic.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>These empirical building blocks inspired us of the weight table of asset allocation for different regimes.&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="472" height="458" src="/uploads/tyvix asset rot strat deck1.svg" /></center><p>This asset rotation strategy has a very good historical performance in backtest, the following is the non-compounded cumulative return chart: &nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="1067" height="347" src="/uploads/stabiliscumret3.svg" /></center><p>If we look into the performance table, we can find that Stabilis has a much higher risk-adjusted return than the 60 / 40 benchmark or AGG itself. In addition, the maximum drawdown of Stabilis is much smaller than other assets.&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="700" height="179" src="/uploads/stabilisperformance.svg" /></center></div>
