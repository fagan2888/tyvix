        <div class="content editable"><p>Some interest rate derivatives--most prominently, interest rate swaps--are quoted and traded in terms of yield instead of price, which requires a different framework for calculating P&amp;L and risk management.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's say a dealer crosses a 10-year swap on a $10 million notional at 1.65% / 1.67% to capture a 2 bp spread. The P&amp;L on that trade is <em>not</em>&nbsp;</p><p>$$10,000,000 \times (0.0167-0.0165) \div 0.0165 = \$1,212.12$$</p><p>&nbsp;as one might calculate for a stock, but is instead approximately&nbsp;</p><p>$$10,000 \times (0.0167 - 0.0165) \times 9,312.05 = \$18,624.10$$</p><p>&nbsp;where 9,312.05 is the price value of a one basis point change in the swap rate (``PVBP'' or ``PV01''). Dollar value of a basis point (``DV01'') is sometimes used to refer to the dollar value of a one basis point shift in the entire curve.</p><p>A good trader has a rough idea of what the PV01 and DV01 of a position are at all times, so all she needs to know is how many basis points she made or lost to estimate P&amp;L. For the same reason, she thinks about volatility in terms of basis points, e.g. ``I expect the swap rate to move by no more than 3bps in either direction on most days.'' This is why we designed the CBOE Interest Rate Swap Volatility Index (SRVIX) to be quoted in terms of basis point volatility instead of percentage volatility, and it takes on values like 85 bps.<br />&nbsp;</p></div>
