        <div class="content"><p>Some interest rate derivatives--most prominently, interest rate swaps--are quoted and traded in terms of yield instead of price, which requires a different framework for calculating P&amp;L and risk management.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's say a dealer crosses a 10-year swap on a $10 million notional at 1.65% / 1.67% to capture a 2 bp spread. The P&amp;L on that trade is <em>not</em>&nbsp;</p><p>$$10,000,000 \times (0.0167-0.0165) \div 0.0165 = \$1,212.12$$</p><p>&nbsp;as one might calculate for a stock, but is instead approximately&nbsp;</p><p>$$10,000 \times (0.0167 - 0.0165) \times 9,312.05 = \$18,624.10$$</p><p>&nbsp;where 9,312.05 is the price value of a one basis point change in the swap rate ("PVBP" or "PV01"). Dollar value of a basis point (``DV01'') is sometimes used to refer to the dollar value of a one basis point shift in the entire curve.</p><p>A good trader has a rough idea of what the PV01 and DV01 of a position are at all times, so all she needs to know is how many basis points she made or lost to estimate P&amp;L. For the same reason, she thinks about volatility in terms of basis points, e.g. ``I expect the swap rate to move by no more than 3bps in either direction on most days.'' This is why we designed the CBOE Interest Rate Swap Volatility Index (SRVIX) to be quoted in terms of basis point volatility instead of percentage volatility, and it takes on values like 85 bps.<br />&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><p><strong>Why TYVIX is not quoted in basis point volatility</strong></p><p>There was a thoughtful debate about which volatility convention to use for Treasury volatility when designing TYVIX since Treasuries have both a price and a yield. After consultations with numerous major market participants, we decided to go with percentage price volatility in keeping with the price-based convention of options on Treasury futures on the CBOT.</p><p>The main problem with a basis point yield formulation that emerged from our market consultations was the fact that different traders have different models for converting the implied volatility of options written on Treasury futures <em>prices</em>&nbsp;to basis point implied volatility of hypothetical options written on corresponding forward Treasury yields. This conversion is actually quite complex to do precisely, and involves a model of the term structure calibrated to market prices as well as a model of "switch risk'' to account for the risk that the cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) bond for the underlying future may change through time.</p><p>We decided against arbitrarily picking one dealer's model-based conversion method to create a bp yield volatility index, which provides the following advantages</p><ol><li>Simplicity: the conversion adds complexity to the index calculation</li><li>Transparency: the conversion obfuscates the index calculation</li><li>Model-independence: the conversion would clash with many end users' risk models</li><li>Flexibility: end users can use their proprietary methods or the simple rule below to convert</li><li>Trading opportunities: those with superior conversion methods may find trading opportunities</li></ol><p>and disadvantages</p><ol><li>Index conversion: to do a simple conversion to bp volatility, one needs to perform some simple arithmetic (see below)</li><li>Contract numbers: to adjust the number of TYVIX futures to trade bp volatility, one needs to perform some simple arithmetic (see below)<br /><strong></strong></li></ol><h3>The Kindergarten conversion rule</h3><p>When switch risk is negligible, then a simple approximation of basis point volatility is to divide TYVIX by the modified duration of the CTD and multiply by 100. For example, if TYVIX is 5.11% and the modified duration is 6.21, then:</p><p>$$\text{TYVIX}^{\text{bp}} = 5.11 / 6.21 \times 100 = 82.28 \text{bps}$$&nbsp;</p><h3>Trading basis point yield volatility with TYVIX futures</h3><p>When switch risk can be safely ignored and assuming modified duration remains relatively constant, one can calculate the number of contracts required to gain a certain dollar exposure to a one basis point change in basis point yield volatility (``bp vega'') by the following simple formula:<br />$$\text{TYVIX futures contracts} = \text{bp vega} / \text{mod duration}\times 100 / 1,000$$</p><p>For example, if one wished to be long $25,000 &nbsp;bp vega and the modified duration is 6.2, then one would purchase</p><p>$$ 25,000 / 6.2 \times 100 / 1,000 = 403 \text{ contracts}$$</p><p><strong>A quasi-model-independent formulation of Treasury yield volatility</strong><br /><br />See Chapter [X] in [Springer book].<br />%graphic of Springer textbook<br />&nbsp;</p></div>
