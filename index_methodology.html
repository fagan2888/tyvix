        <div class="content editable"><h2>TYVIX Methodology</h2><p>TYVIX is based on an adaptation of the VIX Methodology to calculating the 30-day clean implied volatility of 10-year Treasury Note Futures ("TY") traded at CME Group's Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) by aggregating prices of ATM and OTM TY options.<br /><br />Let's go over the main steps using data of Jan 15, 2014 as an example:</p><p>1. determine the option maturities required to calculate a 30-day variance</p><ul><li>if the 1st month option is within one week to expiry, select the 2nd and 3rd month expiries</li><li>if the 1st month option has more than one week to expiry, select the 1st and 2nd month expiries</li><li>if the 1st month option has exactly 30 days to expiry, select only that expiry</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The 1st, 2nd, 3rd month options available on Jan 15, 2014 were Jan, Feb, and Mar options:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ### add the table<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In this case, the 1st month option and the 2nd month option should be chosen as near-term and next-term options.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Get the interest rate curve. TYVIX methodology uses the interest rate data from U.S. Department of the Treasury.&nbsp;<br />The interest rate curve is calculated based on a cubic spline of the available interest rate data. In our example, \(r_{\mathrm{near}} = -0.017\%\), \(r_{\mathrm{next}} = 1.481\%\).&nbsp;</p><p>3. for each option maturity, determine the set of strikes to include in the calculation<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) identify and include the ATM strike (see the following methodology)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) include OTM put strikes until there are two consecutive zero bids</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;(c) include OTM call strikes until there are two consecutive zero bids<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ### add chart; How can we exclude the 0-bid options.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The methodology of determining the ATM strike is as follows:</p><ul><li>calculate the mid-price of call options and put options. Here mid-price is the average of ask price and bid price.&nbsp;</li><li>Find out the strike in which the absolute difference between call option price and put option price is smallest. This strike is used to calculate the forward level F. Take the near-term option on Jan 15, 2014 as an example. As we can see in the table, 124 is the desired strike.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;###add figure: <a href="/charts/chart1.png">how to determine the ATM strikes</a></p><ul><li><p>Calculate the forward level F: $$F = \mathrm{Strike \; price} + e^{rt} \times (\mathrm{Call \; price} - \mathrm{Put \; price})$$ For the near-term option on Jan 15, 2014, \(F_{\mathrm{near}} = 124 + (0.2969 - 0.3359) \times e^{rT_{\mathrm{near}}}\). In the formula, \(r = r_{\mathrm{near}} = -0.017\%\), \(T_{\mathrm{near}} = 13140 / 525600 = 0.025\), so \(F_{\mathrm{near}} = 123.96\).&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Finally, determine the ATM strike. ATM strike here is defined as the strike price immediately below the forward level F. For the near-term option on Jan 15, 2014, the ATM strike is 123.5. For the next-term option, the ATM strike is also 123.5. &nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The strikes we will include in the calculation for the near-term and next term option on Jan 15, 2014 are as follows:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ### add figure: All the strikes we want to include.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
