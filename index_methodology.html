Here mid-price is the average of ask price and bid price<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) Find out the strike in which the absolute difference between call option price and put option price is smallest. This strike is used to calculate the forward level F. Take the near-term option on Jan 15, 2014 as an example:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;###add figure: <a href="/charts/chart1.png">how to determine the ATM strikes</a></p></div>
