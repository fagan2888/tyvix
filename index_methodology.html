<h2 class="editable">TYVIX Methodology</h2>
<p class="editable">TYVIX is based on an adaptation of the VIX Methodology to calculating the 30-day clean implied volatility of 10-year Treasury Note Futures ("TY") traded at CME Group's Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) by aggregating prices of ATM and OTM TY options.<br /><br />Let's go over the main steps using data of Jan 15, 2014 as an example:<br />1. determine the option maturities required to calculate a 30-day variance<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) if the 1st month option is within one week to expiry, select the 2nd and 3rd month expiries<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) if the 1st month option has more than one week to expiry, select the 1st and 2nd month expiries<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(c) if the 1st month option has exactly 30 days to expiry, select only that expiry<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The 1st, 2nd, 3rd month options available on Jan 15, 2014 were Jan, Feb, and Mar options:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ### add the table<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In this case, the 1st month option and the 2nd month option should be chosen as near-term and next-term options.&nbsp;<br /><br />2. for each option maturity, determine the set of strikes to include in the calculation<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) identify and include the ATM strike (see the following methodology)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) include OTM put strikes until there are two consecutive zero bids<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(c) include OTM call strikes until there are two consecutive zero bids<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ### add chart; How can we exclude the 0-bid options.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
