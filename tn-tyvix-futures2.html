        <div class="content editable"><h2>What are futures?</h2><p>A futures contract is a standardized forward contract which can be easily traded between parties other than the two initial parties to the contract. The parties initially agree to buy and sell an asset for a price agreed upon today (the&nbsp;<em>forward price</em>) with delivery and payment occurring at a future point, the&nbsp;<em>delivery date</em>. Because it is a function of an underlying asset, a futures contract is a derivative product.</p><p>Future contracts are negotiated at futures exchanges, which act as a marketplace between buyers and sellers. The buyer of a contract is said to be long position holder, and the selling party is said to be short position holder.</p><p>The first futures contracts were negotiated for agricultural commodities, and later for natural resources such as oil. Financial futures were introduced in 1972, and in recent decades, currency futures, interest rate futures and stock market index futures have played an increasingly large role in the overall futures markets.</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><h2>Popular future contracts</h2><p>There are various future contracts, including commodities, currencies, etc. But they can first be categorized into two very basic types: physical delivery futures and cash settlement futures.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Physical delivery futures: the amount specified of the underlying asset of the contract is delivered by the seller of the contract to the exchange, and by the exchange to the buyers of the contract. Physical delivery is common with commodities and bonds. In practice, it occurs only on a minority of contracts. Most are cancelled out by purchasing a covering position - that is, buying a contract to cancel out an earlier sale (covering a short), or selling a contract to liquidate an earlier purchase (covering a long). Examples of physical delivery futures include 10-Year T-Note Futures, Crude Oil WTI futures, soybeans futures, eurodollar futures, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Cash settlement futures: a cash payment is made based on the underlying reference rate, such as a short-term interest rate index such as 90 Day T-Bills, or the closing value of a stock market index. The parties settle by paying/receiving the loss/gain related to the contract in cash when the contract expires. Cash settled futures are those that, as a practical matter, could not be settled by delivery of the referenced item&mdash;for example, it would be impossible to deliver an index. A futures contract might also opt to settle against an index based on trade in a related spot market. Popular cash settlement futures include E-Mini S&amp;P 500 futures, E-Mini Nasdaq 100 futures, VIX futures, etc.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Physical delivery futures and cash settlement futures are different in pricing. Investors usually use the non-arbitrage argument to price physical delivery futures, because they can actually trade the underlying assets. By assuming that there should be no arbitrage opportunity between spot price and future price, investors can price the physical delivery futures.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this is not true for cash settlement futures, because usually we can't trade the underlying assets for these futures. For example, we can't trade the underlying of VIX futures (which is VIX index), so there is no arbitrage opportunity between underlying VIX index and VIX future price anyway. In this case, we usually price cash settlement futures such as VIX futures using the expectation method. The expectation method can give us an expectation for the future value of the underlying, thus give us a fair price of futures we have today.&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><h2>Features of futures</h2><h3>1. Margins</h3><p>Although futures contract are oriented towards a future time point, their main purpose is to mitigate risk of default by either party in the intervening period. In this vein, the futures exchange requires both parties of the future contract to put up initial cash, or a performance bond, known as the <em>initial margin</em>. The product is marked to market on a daily basis where the difference between the initial agreed-upon price and the actual daily futures price is reevaluated daily. This is sometimes known as the variation margin, where the futures exchange will draw money out of the losing party's margin account and put it into that of the other party, ensuring the correct loss or profit is reflected daily. In case of loss or if the value of the initial margin is being eroded, the broker will make a margin call in order to restore the amount of initial margin available. This is referred to as "maintenance margin".</p><h3>2. Leverage</h3><p>The payment does not happen immediately when investors enter a future position, whereas they just need to pay&nbsp;<em>initial margin</em>&nbsp;to enter a position of futures. The <em>initial margin</em> is usually set as a percentage of the value of the futures contract, so there is a leverage when people trade futures.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Converge to underlying assets</h3><p>As the future contract approaches expiry, the future price and underlying price tend to converge.&nbsp;</p><p>For physical delivery futures, this can be illustrated using an arbitrage argument. For example, suppose the futures contract for crude oil is priced much higher than the spot price as time approaches the contract's month of delivery. In this situation, traders will have the arbitrage opportunity of shorting futures contracts, buying the underlying asset and then making delivery. In this situation, the trader locks in profit because the amount of money received by shorting the contracts already exceeds the amount spent buying the underlying asset to cover the position. As arbitragers continue to do this, the futures prices and spot prices will slowly converge until they are more or less equal. The following is an example of crude oil futures and crude oil spot price. We can see that when it's close to the maturity date of future contract, the future price is nearly equal to crude oil spot price.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="534" height="347" src="/uploads/chartfutureconverge.svg" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>4. Future price term structure</h3><p>There are futures of different maturities for the the same underlying asset on the market. If we plot the future prices according to their time to expiry, we can get a curve of future prices.&nbsp;</p><p>In general, there are two kinds of future price term structures: contango and backwardation. Contango means that the future contract with longer time to expiry are more expensive than the future contract with shorter time to expiry, while backwardation means the opposite. For physical settlement futures, the contango term structure is commonly regarded as the normal market, because this demonstrates that the cost to carry increases with time. However, sometimes we may have backwardation curve, the potential reasons for which may be supply shortages, geopolitical events, etc. For cash settlement futures, things are much more complex.&nbsp;</p><p>The following chart plots the prices of crude oil future contracts, which is a very clear contango shape.&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" width="534" height="347" src="/uploads/chartcurvecontango.svg" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><h2>Advantages of futures</h2><h3>1. Hedge risk of underlying assets</h3><p>Futures can be used to hedge the risk of future price moves in underlying assets, which is one of the main applications of future contract. For companies that will buy / sell certain assets in the future, holding long / short position of futures locks the future price of assets, thus help them avoid suffering a loss from future price moves. &nbsp;</p><p>For example, an oil producer is afraid of a price decline. In November 2014, it anticipated it would sell its November production in December. Its production is 1,000 barrels a day for 19 days. The cash price on Nov 3 is $78.78 per barrel, and Jun 2016 futures are quoted at $80.02 per barrel. Here's what the producer might do in the futures market: sell 19 future contracts (each contract is for 1,000 barrels, so this represents his November production of 19,000 barrels) at $80.02, which locks in a value of his inventory equivalent to $1520,380. If the oil price does decline in December, the futures will also fall in price. In this case the oil producer can use his gain on future contracts to make up his loss in underlying assets. Of course, if the oil price rises in September, this producer can not benefit from the price rise either. As we all know, the oil price declined in December 2014, so this oil producer avoid huge loss in December 2014. The following chart is the P&amp;L of the portfolio with a long position in crude oil spot and a short position in crude oil Jun 2016 future contract from November 2014 to December 2014.&nbsp;</p><p><center><img alt="" src="/uploads/plchart.svg" width="533" height="347" /></center></p><h3>2. Mitigate counter-party risk</h3><p>Like what we have talked about before, traders are required to put up margins when trading futures, and margins are settled on a daily basis. In this case, counterparty risk is largely mitigated.&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><h3>Price TYVIX futures</h3><p>Like what we have discussed before, TYVIX futures are cash-settled so we can't use the non-arbitrage argument to price TYVIX futures. One way to price such kind of futures is to use the expectation method. The expectation method involves calculating a expectation for the future TYVIX values, thus gives us the <em>fair value</em> of TYVIX futures.</p><p>Here we use a methodology based on the works of Carr and Wu (2006) and Dupire (2006), which rely on the key principle that variance is additive in time. Consider, for example, the realized variance of T-Note future returns over the next two months:<br />$$\text{Realized variance}\left( 0,2\right) =\text{Realized variance}\left(0,1\right) +\text{Realized variance}\left( 1,2\right) $$<br />This is simply the sum of two variances: the variance occurring in the first month plus that occurring in the second month. By re-arranging terms<br />and annualizing,</p><p>1. Background</p><p>$$\frac{\text{Realized variance}\left( 1,2\right) }{1/12}=2\times \frac{\text{Realized variance}\left( 0,2\right) }{2/12}-\frac{\text{Realized variance}\left( 0,1\right) }{1/12}$$<br />A one-month TYVIX future delivers the (square root of the) left-hand side of the previous equation that will be realized one month from now. What we need is an expectation of the square root of the left-hand side. Then, an upper bound estimate for the fair value of a one-month TYVIX futures conrtact value is<br />$$F_1=\sqrt{2\times \mathrm{TYVIX}_{2/12}^{2}-1\times \mathrm{TYVIX}_{1/12}^{2}}$$<br />where \(\mathrm{TYVIX_{1/12}}\) and \(\mathrm{TYVIX_{2/12}}\) are implied volatilities calculated using the same methodology as the constant 30-day TYVIX, except based only on the one-month and two-month option series, respectively, which we refer to herein as "single-series TYVIX" indexes.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Single-series TYVIX index</p><p>Because traded options do not commonly have round months to expiry, we generalize the concept above and let the single-series TYVIX level \(X\) based on options expiring at \(T_O\) be defined as<br />$$ X = 100\times\sqrt{ \frac{1}{((T_O-t)/365)}\left\{2 e^{r(\frac{T_O-t}{365})}\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \frac{\Delta K_i}{K_i^2}Q(K_i) - \left(\frac{F}{K_0}-1\right)^2 \right\}}<br />$$ which is the same TYVIX methodology we have talked before. The only difference is we use options of the same time to expiry in this equation, thus it's called "single-series" TYVIX index. In this case, the near-, next-, and third-month single-series TYVIX indexes are needed.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Upper bound on TYVIX futures prices</p><p>We now extend the generalization to fair value calculations for the near- and next-term TYVIX futures prices.&nbsp;</p><p>The notations used in the formulas:</p><ul><li>\(t\) is the current time</li><li>F1 is the price of the near-term TYVIX futures with maturity date \(T_{F_1}\), upper bound \(_tU_{F_1}\), and current fair value \(_tV_{F_1}\)</li><li>F1 is the price of the next-term TYVIX futures with maturity date \(T_{F_2}\), upper bound \(_tU_{F_2}\), and current fair value \(_tV_{F_2}\).</li><li>O1 is the near-term T-Note future option series with maturity \(T_{O_1}\) and corresponding single-series TYVIX value \(X_{O_1}\)</li><li>O2 is the next-term T-Note future option series with maturity \(T_{O_2}\) and corresponding single-series TYVIX value \(X_{O_2}\)</li><li>O3 is the third-term T-Note future option series with maturity \(T_{O_3}\) and corresponding single-series TYVIX value \(X_{O_3}\)</li></ul><p>In this case, there are constraints:</p><ul><li>\(T_{F_1} = &nbsp;T_{O_2} &nbsp;- 30\)</li><li>\(T_{F_2} = &nbsp;T_{O_3} &nbsp;- 30\)</li><li>F1 is the forecast of the Government bond volatility from \(T_{F_1}\) to \(T_{F_1}+30 = T_{O_2}\), and should converge to TYVIX index at \(T_{F_1}\)</li></ul><p>3.1. Upper bound on F2</p><p>With notation out of the way, we start with the calculation of the upper bound on the next-term TYVIX futures price, which is the simpler case as it does not involve any super short-dated options:<br />$$_tU_{F_2} = \sqrt{\frac{X_{O_3}^2\times (T_{O_3}-t) - X_{O_2}^2\times (T_{O_2}-t) }{T_{O_3} - T_{O_2}}}$$</p><p>3.2. Upper bound on F1</p><p>Calculating the upper bound for F1 involves a slight added complexity when the near-term options become super short-dated. To be consistent with the TYVIX calculation methodology, when the near-term option series comes within a week to expiry, we extrapolate forward using the next- and third-term single-series TYVIX values. NB: there is no theoretical justification for this practice and is meant as an expedient to be used with much caution.</p><p>If \(T_{O_1} - t \ge 8\), $$_tU_{F_1} = \sqrt{\frac{X_{O_2}^2\times (T_{O_2}-t) - X_{O_1}^2\times (T_{O_1}-t) }{T_{O_2} - T_{O_1}}}$$</p><p>If \(T_{O_1} - t &lt; 8\), define \(\widetilde{X}_{F_1}\) such that $$ (T_{F_1}-t)\times\widetilde{X}_{F_1}^2 = \max\left\{\frac{T_{F_1} - T_{O_2}}{T_{O_3}-T_{O_2}}((T_{O_3}-t)\times X_{O_3}^2) + \frac{ T_{O_3} - T_{F_1}}{T_{O_3}-T_{O_2}}((T_{O_2}-t)\times X_{O_2}^2), \quad0\right\}$$ which ensures convergence at \({T_{F_1}}\).&nbsp;<br />Then the upper bound is $$_tU_{F_1} = \sqrt{\frac{X_{O_2}^2\times (T_{O_2}-t) - \widetilde{X}_{F_1}^2\times (T_{F_1}-t) }{T_{O_2} - T_{F_1}}}$$</p><p>Note that our approach here deviates from that in <a target="blank" href="/uploads/bbg fvd manual.pdf">Verma (2004)</a>, which documents Bloomberg's implementation of fair value calculations for VIX futures in its FVD calculator. We prefer our approach for its simplicity and seamless ability to handle differences between the various maturity cycles involved in VIX and TYVIX futures fair value calculations. For all intents and purposes, however, the numerical difference between the two approaches should be negligible.</p><p>4. Fair value of TYVIX futures prices</p><p>we must subtract (the square of) the upper bound by a small adjustment term to arrive at the fair value. To this end, we follow the approach taken by <a target="blank" href="/uploads/bbg fvd manual.pdf">Verma (2004)</a> for calculating the fair value of VIX futures.</p><p>Based on the assumption that \(TYVIX_{T_F}\) is log-normally distributed,&nbsp;<br />$$\mathrm{TYVIX}_{T_F} \ = \ U_{F} e^{-\sigma^2_l (T_F - t) + \sigma_l \sqrt{T_F - t} N(0, 1)}$$<br />we get the adjustment equation of TYVIX future fair value as \( _tV_{F} \ = \ E_t[\mathrm{TYVIX}_{T_F}]\), where<br />$$_tV_{F} &nbsp;\ = \ _tU_{F} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\sigma_l^2(T_F - t)}{2}}$$<br />\(T_F\) is the futures maturity and \(\sigma_l\) is the log normal volatility of TYVIX given by<br />$$\sigma_l^2 \ = \ \frac{-\mathrm{log(1 - \frac{\mathrm{Var_t(TYVIX_{T_{F}})}}{ _tU^2_F})}}{T_F - t}$$<br />\(\mathrm{TYVIX}_t\) is the spot TYVIX level, which is assumed to have dynamics<br />$$d\mathrm{TYVIX}_t = \kappa_s(\theta_s-\mathrm{TYVIX}_t)dt + \sigma_sdW_t$$<br />Then we know that the variance of the TYVIX process at \(T_F\) evaluated at t is given by<br />$$\mathrm{Var}_t(\mathrm{TYVIX}_{T_F}) = \sigma_s^2 \frac{1- e^{-2\kappa_s(T_F-t)}}{2\kappa_s}$$<br />We use an autoregressive model to estimate parameters using data of the past year<br />$$\mathrm{TYVIX}_i = a\mathrm{TYVIX}_{i-1} + b + \epsilon_i, \quad i = 1,2,\ldots,252$$<br />The values of \(a, b\) are given by an ordinary least square regression<br />$$<br />\begin{pmatrix}<br />a\\<br />b<br />\end{pmatrix}<br />=<br />\begin{pmatrix}<br />\sum_{i=0}^{251} \mathrm{TYVIX}_i^2 &amp; \sum_{i=0}^{251} \mathrm{TYVIX}_i\\<br />\sum_{i=0}^{251} &nbsp;\mathrm{TYVIX}_i &amp; 252<br />\end{pmatrix}^{-1}<br />\begin{pmatrix}<br />\sum_{i=0}^{251} &amp; \mathrm{TYVIX}_i\times\mathrm{TYVIX}_{i+1}\\<br />\sum_{i=1}^{252} &amp; \mathrm{TYVIX}_i<br />\end{pmatrix}<br />$$<br />According to the solution of the OU process, the corresponding parameters are given by</p><ul><li>\(\Delta t = 1/252\)</li><li>\(\kappa_s = -\frac{\log(a)}{\Delta t}\)</li><li>\(\theta_s = \frac{b}{1-a}\)</li><li>\(\sigma_s^2 = \frac{2\kappa_s\mathrm{Var}(\epsilon)}{1-e^{-2\kappa_s \Delta t}}\)</li></ul></div>
