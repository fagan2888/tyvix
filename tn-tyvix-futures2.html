        <div class="content editable"><h2>TYVIX futures (VXTY)</h2><p>TYVIX futures are derivative contracts listed at the CBOE Futures Exchange that settle to the level of TYVIX, and provide traders with exposure to changes in implied volatility of Treasuries. Unlike options-based volatility trading strategies, TYVIX futures offer pure directional exposure to volatility in the sense that the payoff is linear with respect to the level of TYVIX.</p><h3>Contract specifications</h3><p><strong>Contract size</strong>: $1,000</p><p><strong>Trading hours</strong>: 7:00 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. Chicago time, except that on the Final Settlement Date trading in the expiring VXTY futures will terminate at 2:00 p.m. Chicago time. Non-expiring VXTY futures will continue to trade until 3:15 p.m. on that date.</p><p><strong>Minimum tick</strong>: 0.01 index point for single and multiple leg trades and net prices of spread trades, equal to $10.00 per contract.</p><p><strong>Listed months</strong>: CFE may list for trading up to twelve contract months for the VXTY futures contract.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Termination of trading</strong>: 2:00 p.m. Chicago time on the Final Settlement Date in expiring VXTY futures.</p><p><strong>Final settlement date</strong>: The Wednesday that is thirty days prior to the last Friday of the calendar month immediately following the month in which the VXTY contract expires that precedes the last business day of that month by at least two business days (&ldquo;Final Settlement Date&rdquo;)</p><p><strong>Final settlement value</strong>: The final settlement value for VXTY futures (Ticker: VXTYS) is a Special Quotation (&ldquo;SQ&rdquo;) of VXTY futures calculated using the indicative daily settlement prices (&ldquo;IDS&rdquo;) published by CME Group for the OZN options used to calculate the final settlement value for expiring VXTY futures on their Final Settlement Date.&nbsp;</p><p>Details are subject to change and the reader may find the most up-to-date information <a href="http://cfe.cboe.com/products/spec_tyvix.aspx">here</a>.</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><h3>Pricing TYVIX futures: non-parametric method</h3><p>The non-parametric approach to calculating the fair value of TYVIX futures is based on the works of Carr and Wu (2006) and Dupire (2006), which rely on the principle that variance is additive in time.&nbsp;</p><h4>1. Variance additivity</h4><p>For example, the variance between now and the next two months is simply the sum of the variances in the first month and the second month:<br />$$\text{Realized variance}\left( 0,2\right) =\text{Realized variance}\left(0,1\right) +\text{Realized variance}\left( 1,2\right) $$</p><p>By rearranging terms and annualizing,</p><p>$$\frac{\text{Realized variance}\left( 1,2\right) }{1/12}=2\times \frac{\text{Realized variance}\left( 0,2\right) }{2/12}-\frac{\text{Realized variance}\left( 0,1\right) }{1/12}$$<br />A one-month TYVIX future delivers the (square root of the) left-hand side of the previous equation that will be realized one month from now. Then, an upper bound estimate for the fair value of a one-month TYVIX futures contract value is<br />$$F_1=\sqrt{2\times \mathrm{TYVIX}_{2/12}^{2}-1\times \mathrm{TYVIX}_{1/12}^{2}}$$<br />where \(\mathrm{TYVIX_{1/12}}\) and \(\mathrm{TYVIX_{2/12}}\) are implied volatilities calculated using the same methodology as the constant 30-day TYVIX, except based only on the one-month and two-month option series, respectively, which we refer to herein as "single-series TYVIX" indexes.</p><h4>2. Upper bound on TYVIX futures prices</h4><p>The concept above may be generalized to any option maturities, which allows us to price TYVIX futures with arbitrary times to expiry.</p><p>Given the following notation</p><ul><li>\(t\) is the current time</li><li>F1 is the price of the near-term TYVIX futures with maturity date \(T_{F_1}\), upper bound \(_tU_{F_1}\), and current fair value \(_tV_{F_1}\)</li><li>F2 is the price of the next-term TYVIX futures with maturity date \(T_{F_2}\), upper bound \(_tU_{F_2}\), and current fair value \(_tV_{F_2}\).</li><li>O1 is the near-term T-Note future option series with maturity \(T_{O_1}\) and corresponding single-series TYVIX value \(X_{O_1}\)</li><li>O2 is the next-term T-Note future option series with maturity \(T_{O_2}\) and corresponding single-series TYVIX value \(X_{O_2}\)</li><li>O3 is the third-term T-Note future option series with maturity \(T_{O_3}\) and corresponding single-series TYVIX value \(X_{O_3}\)</li></ul><p>and following constraints</p><ul><li>\(T_{F_1} = &nbsp;T_{O_2} &nbsp;- 30\)</li><li>\(T_{F_2} = &nbsp;T_{O_3} &nbsp;- 30\)</li><li>F1 is the forecast of the Government bond volatility from \(T_{F_1}\) to \(T_{F_1}+30 = T_{O_2}\), and should converge to TYVIX index at \(T_{F_1}\)</li></ul><p>the upper bound on the next-term TYVIX futures price, F2, is<br />$$_tU_{F_2} = \sqrt{\frac{X_{O_3}^2\times (T_{O_3}-t) - X_{O_2}^2\times (T_{O_2}-t) }{T_{O_3} - T_{O_2}}}$$</p><p>Calculating the upper bound for F1 involves a slight added complexity when the near-term options become super short-dated. To be consistent with the TYVIX calculation methodology, when the near-term option series comes within a week to expiry, we extrapolate forward using the next- and third-term single-series TYVIX values. NB: there is no theoretical justification for this practice and is meant as an expedient to be used with much caution.</p><p>If \(T_{O_1} - t \ge 8\), $$_tU_{F_1} = \sqrt{\frac{X_{O_2}^2\times (T_{O_2}-t) - X_{O_1}^2\times (T_{O_1}-t) }{T_{O_2} - T_{O_1}}}$$</p><p>If \(T_{O_1} - t &lt; 8\), define \(\widetilde{X}_{F_1}\) such that $$ (T_{F_1}-t)\times\widetilde{X}_{F_1}^2 = \max\left\{\frac{T_{F_1} - T_{O_2}}{T_{O_3}-T_{O_2}}((T_{O_3}-t)\times X_{O_3}^2) + \frac{ T_{O_3} - T_{F_1}}{T_{O_3}-T_{O_2}}((T_{O_2}-t)\times X_{O_2}^2), \quad0\right\}$$ which ensures convergence at \({T_{F_1}}\).&nbsp;</p><p>Then the upper bound is $$_tU_{F_1} = \sqrt{\frac{X_{O_2}^2\times (T_{O_2}-t) - \widetilde{X}_{F_1}^2\times (T_{F_1}-t) }{T_{O_2} - T_{F_1}}}$$</p><p>Note that our approach here deviates from that in <a target="blank" href="/uploads/bbg fvd manual.pdf">Verma (2004)</a>, which documents Bloomberg's implementation of fair value calculations for VIX futures in its FVD calculator.</p><h4>3. Fair value of TYVIX futures prices</h4><p>We must subtract (the square of) the upper bound by a small adjustment term to arrive at the fair value. To this end, we follow the approach taken by <a target="blank" href="/uploads/bbg fvd manual.pdf">Verma (2004)</a> for calculating the fair value of VIX futures.</p><p>Based on the assumption that \(TYVIX_{T_F}\) is log-normally distributed,&nbsp;<br />$$\mathrm{TYVIX}_{T_F} \ = \ U_{F} e^{-\sigma^2_l (T_F - t) + \sigma_l \sqrt{T_F - t} N(0, 1)}$$<br />we get the adjustment equation of TYVIX future fair value as \( _tV_{F} \ = \ E_t[\mathrm{TYVIX}_{T_F}]\), where<br />$$_tV_{F} &nbsp;\ = \ _tU_{F} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\sigma_l^2(T_F - t)}{2}}$$<br />\(T_F\) is the futures maturity and \(\sigma_l\) is the log normal volatility of TYVIX given by<br />$$\sigma_l^2 \ = \ \frac{-\mathrm{log(1 - \frac{\mathrm{Var_t(TYVIX_{T_{F}})}}{ _tU^2_F})}}{T_F - t}$$<br />\(\mathrm{TYVIX}_t\) is the spot TYVIX level, which is assumed to have dynamics<br />$$d\mathrm{TYVIX}_t = \kappa_s(\theta_s-\mathrm{TYVIX}_t)dt + \sigma_sdW_t$$<br />Then we know that the variance of the TYVIX process at \(T_F\) evaluated at t is given by<br />$$\mathrm{Var}_t(\mathrm{TYVIX}_{T_F}) = \sigma_s^2 \frac{1- e^{-2\kappa_s(T_F-t)}}{2\kappa_s}$$<br />We use an autoregressive model to estimate parameters using data of the past year<br />$$\mathrm{TYVIX}_i = a\mathrm{TYVIX}_{i-1} + b + \epsilon_i, \quad i = 1,2,\ldots,252$$<br />The values of \(a, b\) are given by an ordinary least square regression<br />$$<br />\begin{pmatrix}<br />a\\<br />b<br />\end{pmatrix}<br />=<br />\begin{pmatrix}<br />\sum_{i=0}^{251} \mathrm{TYVIX}_i^2 &amp; \sum_{i=0}^{251} \mathrm{TYVIX}_i\\<br />\sum_{i=0}^{251} &nbsp;\mathrm{TYVIX}_i &amp; 252<br />\end{pmatrix}^{-1}<br />\begin{pmatrix}<br />\sum_{i=0}^{251} &amp; \mathrm{TYVIX}_i\times\mathrm{TYVIX}_{i+1}\\<br />\sum_{i=1}^{252} &amp; \mathrm{TYVIX}_i<br />\end{pmatrix}<br />$$<br />According to the solution of the OU process, the corresponding parameters are given by</p><ul><li>\(\Delta t = 1/252\)</li><li>\(\kappa_s = -\frac{\log(a)}{\Delta t}\)</li><li>\(\theta_s = \frac{b}{1-a}\)</li><li>\(\sigma_s^2 = \frac{2\kappa_s\mathrm{Var}(\epsilon)}{1-e^{-2\kappa_s \Delta t}}\)</li></ul><p>A Microsoft Excel implementation of this fair value calculation with real-time Bloomberg data feeds is available here.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pricing TYVIX futures: non-parametric approach&nbsp;</h3></div>
