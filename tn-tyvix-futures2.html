        <div class="content editable"><h1>What are futures?</h1><p>A futures contract (more colloquially, futures) is a standardized forward contract which can be easily traded between parties other than the two initial parties to the contract. The parties initially agree to buy and sell an asset for a price agreed upon today (the&nbsp;<em>forward price</em>) with delivery and payment occurring at a future point, the&nbsp;<em>delivery date</em>. Because it is a function of an underlying asset, a futures contract is a derivative product.</p><p>Future contracts are negotiated at futures exchanges, which act as a marketplace between buyers and sellers. The buyer of a contract is said to be long position holder, and the selling party is said to be short position holder.</p><p>The first futures contracts were negotiated for agricultural commodities, and later for natural resources such as oil.Financial futures were introduced in 1972, and in recent decades, currency futures, interest rate futures and stock market index futures have played an increasingly large role in the overall futures markets.</p></div>

        <div class="content editable"><h1>Popular future contracts</h1><p>There are various future contracts, including commodities, currencies, etc. But all the futures can be categorized into two types: physical delivery futures and cash settlement futures.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Physical delivery futures: the amount specified of the underlying asset of the contract is delivered by the seller of the contract to the exchange, and by the exchange to the buyers of the contract. Physical delivery is common with commodities and bonds. In practice, it occurs only on a minority of contracts. Most are cancelled out by purchasing a covering position - that is, buying a contract to cancel out an earlier sale (covering a short), or selling a contract to liquidate an earlier purchase (covering a long).&nbsp;</li><li>Cash settlement futures: a cash payment is made based on the underlying reference rate, such as a short-term interest rate index such as 90 Day T-Bills, or the closing value of a stock market index. The parties settle by paying/receiving the loss/gain related to the contract in cash when the contract expires. Cash settled futures are those that, as a practical matter, could not be settled by delivery of the referenced item&mdash;for example, it would be impossible to deliver an index. A futures contract might also opt to settle against an index based on trade in a related spot market. ICE Brent futures use this method.</li></ul></div>

        <div class="content editable"><h2>Price TYVIX futures</h2><p>Like what we have discussed before, TYVIX futures are cashed settled so we can't use the non-arbitrage argument to price TYVIX futures. Here we use a methodology based on the works of Carr and Wu (2006) and Dupire (2006), which rely on the key principle that variance is additive in time. Consider, for example, the realized variance of T-Note future returns over the next two months:<br />$$\text{Realized variance}\left( 0,2\right) =\text{Realized variance}\left(0,1\right) +\text{Realized variance}\left( 1,2\right) $$<br />This is simply the sum of two variances: the variance occurring in the first month plus that occurring in the second month. By re-arranging terms<br />and annualizing,</p><p>1. Background</p><p>$$\frac{\text{Realized variance}\left( 1,2\right) }{1/12}=2\times \frac{\text{Realized variance}\left( 0,2\right) }{2/12}-\frac{\text{Realized variance}\left( 0,1\right) }{1/12}$$<br />A one-month TYVIX future delivers the (square root of the) left-hand side of the previous equation that will be realized one month from now. Then, an upper bound estimate for the fair value of a one-month TYVIX futures conrtact value is<br />$$F_1=\sqrt{2\times \mathrm{TYVIX}_{2/12}^{2}-1\times \mathrm{TYVIX}_{1/12}^{2}}$$<br />where \(\mathrm{TYVIX_{1/12}}\) and \(\mathrm{TYVIX_{2/12}}\) are implied volatilities calculated using the same methodology as the constant 30-day TYVIX, except based only on the one-month and two-month option series, respectively, which we refer to herein as "single-series TYVIX" indexes.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Single-series TYVIX index</p><p>Because traded options do not commonly have round months to expiry, we generalize the concept above and let the single-series TYVIX level $X$ based on options expiring at \(T_O\) be defined as<br />$$ X = 100\times\sqrt{ \frac{1}{((T_O-t)/365)}\left\{2 e^{r(\frac{T_O-t}{365})}\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \frac{\Delta K_i}{K_i^2}Q(K_i) - \left(\frac{F}{K_0}-1\right)^2 \right\}}<br />$$ which is the same TYVIX methodology we have talked before. In this case, the near-, next-, and third-month single-series TYVIX indexes are needed.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Upper bound on TYVIX futures prices</p><p>We now extend the generalization to fair value calculations for the near- and next-term TYVIX futures prices.&nbsp;</p><p>The notations used in the formulas:</p><p>\(t\) is the current time</p><p>F1 is the price of the near-term TYVIX futures with maturity date \(T_{F_1}\), upper bound \(_tU_{F_1}\), and current fair value \(_tV_{F_1}\)</p><p>F1 is the price of the next-term TYVIX futures with maturity date \(T_{F_2}\), upper bound \(_tU_{F_2}\), and current fair value \(_tV_{F_2}\).</p><p>O1 is the near-term T-Note future option series with maturity \(T_{O_1}\) and corresponding single-series TYVIX value \(X_{O_1}\)</p><p>O2 is the next-term T-Note future option series with maturity \(T_{O_2}\) and corresponding single-series TYVIX value \(X_{O_2}\)</p><p>O3 is the third-term T-Note future option series with maturity \(T_{O_3}\) and corresponding single-series TYVIX value \(X_{O_3}\)</p><p>In this case, there are constraints:</p><p>\(T_{F_1} = &nbsp;T_{O_2} &nbsp;- 30\)</p><p>\(T_{F_2} = &nbsp;T_{O_3} &nbsp;- 30\)</p><p>F1 is the forecast of the Government bond volatility from \(T_{F_1}\) to \(T_{F_1}+30 = T_{O_2}\), and should converge to TYVIX index at \(T_{F_1}\)</p><p>3.1. Upper bound on F2</p><p>With notation out of the way, we start with the calculation of the upper bound on the next-term TYVIX futures price, which is the simpler case as it does not involve any super short-dated options:<br />$$_tU_{F_2} = \sqrt{\frac{X_{O_3}^2\times (T_{O_3}-t) - X_{O_2}^2\times (T_{O_2}-t) }{T_{O_3} - T_{O_2}}}$$</p><p>3.2. Upper bound on F1</p><p>Calculating the upper bound for F1 involves a slight added complexity when the near-term options become super short-dated. To be consistent with the TYVIX calculation methodology, when the near-term option series comes within a week to expiry, we extrapolate forward using the next- and third-term single-series TYVIX values. NB: there is no theoretical justification for this practice and is meant as an expedient to be used with much caution.</p><p>If \(T_{O_1} - t \ge 8\), $$_tU_{F_1} = \sqrt{\frac{X_{O_2}^2\times (T_{O_2}-t) - X_{O_1}^2\times (T_{O_1}-t) }{T_{O_2} - T_{O_1}}}$$</p><p>If \(T_{O_1} - t &lt; 8\), define \(\widetilde{X}_{F_1}\) such that $$ (T_{F_1}-t)\times\widetilde{X}_{F_1}^2 = \max\left\{\frac{T_{F_1} - T_{O_2}}{T_{O_3}-T_{O_2}}((T_{O_3}-t)\times X_{O_3}^2) + \frac{ T_{O_3} - T_{F_1}}{T_{O_3}-T_{O_2}}((T_{O_2}-t)\times X_{O_2}^2), \quad0\right\}$$ which ensures convergence at \({T_{F_1}}\).&nbsp;<br />Then the upper bound is $$_tU_{F_1} = \sqrt{\frac{X_{O_2}^2\times (T_{O_2}-t) - \widetilde{X}_{F_1}^2\times (T_{F_1}-t) }{T_{O_2} - T_{F_1}}}$$</p><p>Note that our approach here deviates from that in Varma (2004), which documents Bloomberg's implementation of fair value calculations for VIX futures in its FVD calculator. We prefer our approach for its simplicity and seamless ability to handle differences between the various maturity cycles involved in VIX and TYVIX futures fair value calculations. For all intents and purposes, however, the numerical difference between the two approaches should be negligible.</p><p>4. Fair value of TYVIX futures prices</p><p>we must subtract (the square of) the upper bound by a small adjustment term to arrive at the fair value. To this end, we follow the approach taken by Verma (2004) for calculating the fair value of VIX futures.</p><p>Based on the assumption that $TYVIX_{T_F}$ is log-normally distributed,&nbsp;<br />$$\mathrm{TYVIX}_{T_F} \ = \ U_{F} e^{-\sigma^2_l (T_F - t) + \sigma_l \sqrt{T_F - t} N(0, 1)}$$<br />we get the adjustment equation of TYVIX future fair value as \( _tV_{F} \ = \ E_t[\mathrm{TYVIX}_{T_F}]\), where<br />$$_tV_{F} &nbsp;\ = \ _tU_{F} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\sigma_l^2(T_F - t)}{2}}$$<br />\(T_F\) is the futures maturity and \(\sigma_l\) is the log normal volatility of TYVIX given by<br />$$\sigma_l^2 \ = \ \frac{-\mathrm{log(1 - \frac{\mathrm{Var_t(TYVIX_{T_{F}})}}{ _tU^2_F})}}{T_F - t}$$<br />\(\mathrm{TYVIX}_t\) is the spot TYVIX level, which is assumed to have dynamics<br />$$d\mathrm{TYVIX}_t = \kappa_s(\theta_s-\mathrm{TYVIX}_t)dt + \sigma_sdW_t$$<br />Then we know that the variance of the TYVIX process at \(T_F\) evaluated at t is given by<br />$$\mathrm{Var}_t(\mathrm{TYVIX}_{T_F}) = \sigma_s^2 \frac{1- e^{-2\kappa_s(T_F-t)}}{2\kappa_s}$$<br />We use an autoregressive model to estimate parameters using data of the past year<br />$$\mathrm{TYVIX}_i = a\mathrm{TYVIX}_{i-1} + b + \epsilon_i, \quad i = 1,2,\ldots,252$$<br />The values of \(a, b\) are given by an ordinary least square regression<br />$$<br />\begin{pmatrix}<br />a\\<br />b<br />\end{pmatrix}<br />=<br />\begin{pmatrix}<br />\sum_{i=0}^{251} \mathrm{TYVIX}_i^2 &amp; \sum_{i=0}^{251} \mathrm{TYVIX}_i\\<br />\sum_{i=0}^{251} &nbsp;\mathrm{TYVIX}_i &amp; 252<br />\end{pmatrix}^{-1}<br />\begin{pmatrix}<br />\sum_{i=0}^{251} &amp; \mathrm{TYVIX}_i\times\mathrm{TYVIX}_{i+1}\\<br />\sum_{i=1}^{252} &amp; \mathrm{TYVIX}_i<br />\end{pmatrix}<br />$$<br />According to the solution of the OU process, the corresponding parameters are given by</p><p>\(\Delta t = 1/252\)</p><p>\(\kappa_s = -\frac{\log(a)}{\Delta t}\)</p><p>\(\theta_s = \frac{b}{1-a}\)</p><p>\(\sigma_s^2 = \frac{2\kappa_s\mathrm{Var}(\epsilon)}{1-e^{-2\kappa_s \Delta t}}\)</p></div>
