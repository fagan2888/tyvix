        <div class="content editable"><h2>Repurchase Agreements ("Repo")</h2><p>A prevalent short-term funding mechanism that uses Treasuries as collateral is a transaction called a repurchase agreement, also know as a repo. In a Treasury repo, one party agrees to lend cash while the other party posts Treasuries as collateral. Treasuries as collateral allow for very large quantities of repo agreements to be executed every day, commonly on an overnight basis at low interest rates.&nbsp;</p><p>Many individuals and institutions access this mechanism indirectly through money market funds, which are heavy suppliers of cash through repos. On the other side of this trade are institutions, such as dealers and asset managers, that fund securities holdings by lending them out through repos. The Fed also uses repos to adjust reserve balances as a monetary policy tool as we touched upon earlier.</p><p>Certain types of money market funds, often labeled ``prime,'' also invest in non-governmental securities such as commercial paper, which are high-quality unsecured short-term corporate debt, and constitute an indispensable shadow banking system for blue chip companies. They offer higher yield and function smoothly during periods of market calm; however, the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008 highlighted the unrivaled virtue of Treasuries by contrast when prime funds experienced a run by investors and required governmental guarantees to successfully stem massive outflows and a potential cascade of defaults by major corporations. Imagine the disaster that would have ensued if it were not for investors' steadfast faith in the US Treasury!<br />&nbsp;</p></div>
